  abstract = {In Santa Catarina, southern Brazil, family farmers modified the conventional no-till system by flattening cover crop mixtures on the soil surface as a strategy to reduce soil erosion and lower fluctuations in soil moisture and temperature, improve soil quality, and enhance weed suppression and crop performance. During 2007 and 2008, we conducted three experiments aimed at understanding the processes and mechanisms at play in successful organic conservation tillage systems (OCT), especially the underpinnings of ecological weed suppression, a key advantage of OCT systems over conventional no-till systems. Our results, as well as farmers observations, suggest that cover crops can enhance weed suppression and hence crop productivity through physical interference and allelopathy and also a host of effects on soil quality, fertility, and soil moisture that we did not measure. Results from the three trials indicate that the best cover crop mixture should include a significant proportion of rye, vetch, and fodder radish as these mixtures produce large biomass, and are readily killed by rolling forming a thick mulch sufficient to provide effective weed control in the subsequent vegetable crop.},

The newest agricultural frontier in Brazil is the Matopiba region, which is a continuous zone formed by the states of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí, and Bahia, located mostly within the Cerrado biome. The objective of this study was to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of soybean production and yield in the Matopiba region. We analyzed municipality-based planted areas and production data obtained by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics during 1990–2015. Yield was estimated from the production and planted area, and the data were analyzed using global and local Moran indices. The results showed that soybean production in the Matopiba region does not occur randomly. Positive and significant autocorrelation was found at the beginning of the time series among those municipalities located in the west of Bahia. This region influenced the soybean expansion from south to north. Currently, high-production areas are concentrated in two autocorrelated blocks: one in western Bahia and the other in the central Matopiba region. Analysis of spatial autocorrelation involving yield showed a decreasing trend at the end of the time series. The presence of municipalities with high yield surrounded by others with low yield, and vice-versa, were observed. The findings of this study could assist local and regional agricultural planning in the Matopiba region, and support related analyses in other fields of agriculture, the environment, and logistics.},

1-trimethyl-1,3-diaminopropane (TA) salts of dicamba (3,6-dichloro-o-anisic acid), developed dicamba injury symptoms. Dicamba volatilization from treated corn was detected with soybeans for 3 days after the application. Dicamba vapors caused symptoms on soybeans placed up to 60m downwind of the treated corn. When vapor and/or spray drift caused soybean terminal bud kill, yields were reduced. In growth chamber studies, dicamba volatility effects on soybeans could be reduced by lowering the temperature or increasing the relative humidity. Rainfall of 1mm or more on treated corn ended dicamba volatilization. The dicamba volatilization was greater from corn and soybean leaves than from velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medic.) leaves and blotter paper. The volatilization of dicamba formulations varied in growth chamber comparisons with the acid being most volatile and the inorganic salts being the least volatile. However, under field conditions, use of less volatile formulations did not eliminate dicamba symptoms on soybeans. The volatile component of the commercial DMA salt of dicamba was identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as free dicamba acid.},

Seed movement is analyzed both from an agronomic and ecological perspective, focusing predominantly on horizontal seed movement.Abiotic (anemochory and hydrochory), as well as biotic (autochory, myrmecochory, epizoochory, and endozoochory) weed seed dispersal typologies are examined, highlighting the mechanisms involved, the specializations displayed by weed species that have evolved by exploiting a particular dispersal mechanism, and their adaptive interaction with the surrounding ecosystem. Emphasis is also placed on the crucial role of human activity (anthropochory), which can affect natural (biotic and abiotic) weed seed dispersal at several stages, partly via the worldwide commercial seed trade but, above all, by crop management operations, thereby potentially facilitating the entry and spread of alien weed species.This phenomenon, together with the invasive expansion of existing weeds that more successfully coevolve and adapt to the new environment, might exert an adverse effect on biodiversity. In-depth knowledge of weed seed dispersal, survival, and germination mechanisms is therefore essential for effective and eco-compatible management of the weed phytocoenoses present in the agroecosystem in order to promote a rational trade-off between agricultural productivity and environmental protection.},

The SVA map comprised 21 111 map units (MU) that were spread into 75 different SVA categories. Mean representative C stocks (RCS) of the SVA categories ranged from 1.51 to 41.78 kg C mϪ2. More than three fourth of all SVA areas had an associated RCS varying between 3 and 6 kg C mϪ2. Because these data represent sites with native vegetation in the absence of significant disturbances, they represent a valuable baseline for evaluating the effect of land-use change on soil C stocks for Brazil. In total, about 36.4 Ϯ 3.4 Pg C was stored in the 0- to 30-cm soil layer.},

These areas have been overlooked in terms of land cover change assessment if compared with efforts in monitoring the Amazon rain forest. For each of the target years (1990, 2000 and 2010) land cover information was obtained through an object-based classification approach for 243 sample units (10~~km~×~10~~km size), using (E)TM Landsat images systematically located at each full degree confluence of latitude and longitude. The images were automatically pre-processed, segmented and labelled according to the following legend: Tree Cover (TC), Tree Cover Mosaic (TCM), Other Wooded Land (OWL), Other Land Cover (OLC) and Water (W). Our results indicate the Cerrado and Caatinga biomes lost (gross loss) respectively 265,595~km2 and 89,656~km2 of natural vegetation (TC~+~OWL) between 1990 and 2010. In the same period, these areas also experienced gain of TC and OWL. By 2010, the percentage of natural vegetation cover remaining in the Cerrado was 47\% and in the Caatinga 63\%. The annual (net) rate of natural vegetation cover loss in the Cerrado slowed down from~−0.79\%~yr−1 to~−0.44\%~yr−1 from the 1990s to the 2000s, while in the Caatinga for the same periods the rate increased from~−0.19\%~yr−1 to~−0.44\%~yr−1. In summary, these Brazilian biomes experienced both loss and gains of Tree Cover and Other Wooded Land; however a continued net loss of natural vegetation was observed for both biomes between 1990 and 2010. The average annual rate of change in this period was higher in the Cerrado (−0.6\%~yr−1) than in the Caatinga (−0.3\%~yr−1).},

  abstract = {The introduction of soybean and cotton traits with resistance to synthetic auxin herbicides has led to an increase in concern over the off-target movement of dicamba and 2,4-D. A direct-mail survey was sent to Missouri pesticide applicators in January of 2016 to understand current herbicide application practices and applicator knowledge and awareness of the new synthetic auxin technologies. Completed surveys were returned by 2,335 applicators, representing approximately 11\% of the state’s registered pesticide applicators. Survey data reported herein provides information regarding current pesticide applicator knowledge and practices and highlights areas that need more emphasis during applicator training. Overall, survey respondents were familiar with physical drift and methods to minimize that risk. However respondents were less familiar with volatility and temperature inversions, which can each influence off-target herbicide movement. Of the 427 commercial applicators and 1,535 noncommercial applicators who answered questions regarding volatility, 81\% and 74\% respectively, recognized that high temperatures can contribute to a herbicide’s ability to volatilize. However, only 48\% and 39\% understood that a herbicide’s vapor pressure influences volatility. Answers from the survey indicate further education is needed on the synthetic auxin technologies, such as what herbicides can be used with each technology, proper methods for inspecting and cleaning spray equipment, and the importance of reading herbicide labels. When asked whether applicators were aware of the new 2,4-D-resistant and dicamba-resistant traits, 76\% of 443 commercial applicators and only 40\% of 1,713 noncommercial applicators selected “yes.” Additionally, survey results suggests that current methods aimed to facilitate communication among producers and applicators, such as FieldWatch and Flag the Technology, may not be successfully adopted, at least in Missouri. Findings from this survey can be utilized to enhance training of pesticide applicators in preparation for the synthetic auxin herbicide technologies.

La introducción de soja y algodón con resistencia a herbicidas auxinas sintéticas ha generado preocupación por el movimiento accidental de dicamba y 2,4−D a lugares no deseados. En Enero de 2016 se envió una encuesta vía correo directo a aplicadores de plaguicidas con licencia de Missouri para entender las prácticas de aplicación de herbicidas actuales y el conocimiento de los aplicadores acerca de las nuevas tecnologías de auxinas sintéticas. Se recibieron 2,335 encuestas completadas por aplicadores, lo que representó 11\% del registro de aplicadores de plaguicidas del estado. Los datos de la encuesta presentados aquí brindan información acerca del conocimiento y prácticas actuales de los aplicadores de plaguicidas y resaltan las áreas que necesitan mayor énfasis para la capacitación de los aplicadores. En general, los encuestados estaban familiarizados con la volatilidad y las inversiones de temperatura, las cuales pueden influenciar el movimiento accidental del herbicida a zonas no deseadas. De los 427 aplicadores comerciales y los 1,535 aplicadores no comerciales que contestaron las preguntas relacionadas a volatilidad, 81\% y 74\% respectivamente, reconocieron que las altas temperaturas pueden contribuir a la habilidad del herbicida de volatilizarse. Sin embargo, solamente 48\% y 39\% entendía que la presión de vapor del herbicida influencia la volatilidad. Las respuestas en la encuesta indican que se necesita más educación acerca de las tecnologías con auxinas sintéticas, como cuáles herbicidas pueden ser usados con cada tecnología, métodos adecuados para inspeccionar y limpiar los equipos de aspersión, y la importancia de leer la etiqueta del herbicida. Cuando se preguntó si los aplicadores estaban al tanto de los nuevos cultivos con resistencia a 2,4−D y dicamba, 76\% de 443 aplicadores comerciales y solamente 40\% de 1,713 aplicadores no comerciales seleccionaron “sí”. Adicionalmente, los resultados de la encuesta sugieren que los métodos actuales dirigidos a facilitar la comunicación entre productores y aplicadores, tales como FieldWatch y la tecnología de Banderas, podrían no ser adoptadas exitosamente, al menos en Missouri. Los descubrimientos de esta encuesta pueden ser utilizados para mejorar la capacitación de aplicadores de plaguicidas en preparación para el uso de las tecnologías de herbicidas auxinas sintéticas.},

  abstract = {Brazil has a total area of 850 million ha, of which 90\% is within the tropics. Historically, the system of exploitation of the land for agriculture and forestry was based on land clearing, cultivation for some years and then moving on to new areas. This process often left degraded areas behind, especially in the mountainous areas of the country. With modern agricultural technology, crops can be successfully grown in virtually any region of the country. The current challenge for Brazil is to feed its population and provide agricultural surpluses for the growing export markets, while preserving its rich and biologically-diverse native vegetation which still covers almost half of the country. The objective of this review is to trace the history of agricultural activity in this country, and to assess the sustainability of the cropping and pasture systems which today occupy the largest areas. At present approximately 50 million ha are under annual and perennial crops, while almost twice this area is under pastures. These pastures, predominately Brachiaria spp., are mostly in a degraded state due to lack of fertilization and over grazing. The various options available to recover these pastures or convert these areas for sustainable cropping are explained. In recent years, increasing proportions of soybean, wheat, and corn are produced under zero tillage which favors the conservation of soil organic matter. This not only radically reduces the risk of erosion but also increases the capacity of the soils to retain nutrients and water. Small holders who represent a considerable fraction of Brazil's food crop production, generally do not have access to fertilizers or other agricultural chemicals. They obtain very low yields and their farming practices exhaust the soil of nutrients. The Brazilian sugarcane industry is the largest in the world and recent changes in the management of this crop and its impact upon sustainability issues are also discussed. Brazil also has vast areas of degraded pastures and abandoned hillsides that can be used for agricultural expansion. This would prevent further destruction of native vegetation and its accompanying biological diversity for agriculture.},

RESULTS Two C. elata populations, one glyphosate resistant (GR) and one glyphosate susceptible (GS), were studied in detail for a dose–response experiment and for resistance mechanism. The dose causing 50\% reduction in dry weight was 620 g a.e. ha−1 for GR and 114 g ha−1 for GS, resulting in an R/S ratio of 5.4. GS had significantly higher maximum 14C-glyphosate absorption into the treated leaf (51.3\%) than GR (39.5\%), a difference of 11.8\% in maximum absorption. GR also retained more 14C-glyphosate in the treated leaf (74\%) than GS (51\%), and GR translocated less glyphosate (27\%) to other plant parts (stems, roots and root exudation) than GS (36\%). There were no mutations at the Pro106 codon in the gene encoding 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). There was no difference in EPSPS genomic copy number or EPSPS transcription between GS and GR populations. CONCLUSION Based on these data, reduced glyphosate absorption and increased glyphosate retention in the treated leaf contribute to glyphosate resistance in this C. elata population from Brazil. © 2015 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Seed dispersal, interacting with environmental disturbance and management across heterogeneous landscapes, results in irregular weed spatial distributions. Describing, predicting, and managing weed populations requires an understanding of how weeds are distributed spatially and the consequences of this distribution for population processes. Semivariograms and kriged maps of weed populations in several fields have helped describe spatial structure, but few generalizations can be drawn except that populations are aggregated at one or more scales. Limited information is available on the effect of weed arrangement, pattern, or field location on weed population processes. Because weeds are neither regular nor uniform in distribution, mean density alone is of limited value in estimating yield loss or describing population dynamics over a whole field. Sampling strategies that account for spatial distribution can increase sampling efficiency. Further research should focus on understanding processes that cause changes in spatial distributions over time to help predict rates of invasion and potential extent of colonization.},

  abstract = {Sourgrass is a perennial weed infesting annual and perennial crops in Brazil. Three biotypes (R1, R2, and R3) of sourgrass suspected to be glyphosate-resistant (R) and another one (S) from a natural area without glyphosate application, in Brazil, were tested for resistance to glyphosate based on screening, dose-response, and shikimic acid assays. Both screening and dose-response assays confirmed glyphosate resistance in the three sourgrass biotypes. Dose-response assay indicated a resistance factor of 2.3 for biotype R1 and 3.9 for biotypes R2 and R3. The hypothesis of a glyphosate resistance was corroborated on the basis of shikimic acid accumulation, where the S biotype accumulated 3.3, 5.0, and 5.7 times more shikimic acid than biotypes R1, R2, and R3, respectively, 168 h after treatment with 157.50 g ae ha−1 of glyphosate. There were no differences in contact angle of spray droplets on leaves and spray retention, indicating that differential capture of herbicide by leaves was not responsible for resistance in these biotypes. The results confirmed resistance of sourgrass to glyphosate in Brazil.Nomenclature: Glyphosate; sourgrass, Digitaria insularis (L.) Mez ex Ekman, TRCIN},

  abstract = {In the 2009/2010 growing season, Brazil was the second largest world soybean producer, followed by Argentina. Glyphosate-resistant soybeans (GRS) are being cultivated in most of the soybean area in South America. Overall, the GRS system is beneficial to the environment when compared to conventional soybean. GRS resulted in a significant shift toward no-tillage practices in Brazil and Argentina, but weed resistance may reduce this trend. Probably the highest agricultural risk in adopting GRS in Brazil and South America is related to weed resistance due to use of glyphosate. Weed species in GRS fields have shifted in Brazil to those that can more successfully withstand glyphosate or to those that avoid the time of its application. Five weed species, in order of importance, Conyza bonariensis (L.) Cronquist, Conyza canadensis (L.) Cronquist, Lolium multiflorum Lam., Digitaria insularis (L.) Mez ex Ekman, and Euphorbia heterophylla L., have evolved resistance to glyphosate in GRS in Brazil. Conyza spp. are the most difficult to control. A glyphosate-resistant biotype of Sorghum halepense L. has evolved in GRS in Argentina and one of D. insularis in Paraguay. The following actions are proposed to minimize weed resistance problem: (a) rotation of GRS with conventional soybeans in order to rotate herbicide modes of action; (b) avoidance of lower than recommended glyphosate rates; (c) keeping soil covered with a crop or legume at intercrop intervals; (d) keeping machinery free of weed seeds; and (d) use of a preplant nonselective herbicide plus residuals to eliminate early weed interference with the crop and to minimize escapes from later applications of glyphosate due to natural resistance of older weeds and/or incomplete glyphosate coverage.},

  abstract = {Natural resources conservation is a key national priority of Brazilian cropping systems, especially in the soybean and sugarcane agricultural areas of central/south and southeast/northeast, respectively. Society has influenced growers to adopt “conservation cropping systems”, which results in reduced damage to the agricultural environment (agro ecosystems) as a whole. These systems are based on plant residue covering the soil surface (cover crop or residue after harvest), with a minimum disturbance of the topsoil layer. These systems, when compared to the conventional cropping system, reduce diurnal soil temperature variation, decrease water evaporation from the soil surface, enhance organic matter content and microorganism activity in the topsoil layer, improve both the physical and chemical soil properties, and provide better soil erosion control. The widespread adoption of no tillage soybean production systems has achieved tremendous success in enhancing soil quality and preventing soil erosion. Plant residue covering the soil surface influences the weed population dynamics through chemical (carbon/nitrogen ratio and allelopathy), biological (parasitism and predation by microorganisms, insects and small mammals) and physical factors (less direct sunlight reaching the soil surface, reduced diurnal soil temperature variation and physical obstruction of weed emergence). Weed control by pre-emergence herbicides is also directly affected by the plant residue covering on the soil, since these residues may intercept the herbicide, preventing part of the sprayed herbicide from the soil by adsorption, therefore, influencing the efficacy of the herbicide. Overall weed management tactics need to be studied and reconsidered for this new “conservation cropping system” as compared to the conventional systems.},

  abstract = {South America represents about 12\% of the global land area, and Brazil roughly corresponds to 47\% of that. The major sustainable agricultural system in South America is based on a no-tillage cropping system, which is a worldwide adopted agricultural conservation system. Societal benefits of conservation systems in agriculture include greater use of conservation tillage, which reduces soil erosion and associated loading of pesticides, nutrients and sediments into the environment. However, overreliance on glyphosate and simpler cropping systems has resulted in the selection of tolerant weed species through weed shifts (WSs) and evolution of herbicide-resistant weed (HRW) biotypes to glyphosate. It is a challenge in South America to design herbicide- and non-herbicide-based strategies that effectively delay and/or manage evolution of HRWs and WSs to weeds tolerant to glyphosate in cropping systems based on recurrent glyphosate application, such as those used with glyphosate-resistant soybeans. The objectives of this paper are (i) to provide an overview of some factors that influence WSs and HRWs to glyphosate in South America, especially in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay soybean cropped areas; (ii) to discuss the viability of using crop rotation and/or cover crops that might be integrated with forage crops in an economically and environmentally sustainable system; and (iii) to summarize the results of a survey of the perceptions of Brazilian farmers to problems with WSs and HRWs to glyphosate, and the level of adoption of good agricultural practices in order to prevent or manage it.

Despite this understanding, it is unknown whether finer-scale, within-season variation in the timing of tillage has similar impacts on weed community assembly. We conducted an experiment on four research farms across the northeastern USA to test the effects of tillage timing on weed emergence periodicity. Soil was tilled at 12 different times that were 2 weeks apart from 29 April to 30 September (the entire growing season) and the composition and abundance of the weed seedlings that emerged was measured 6 weeks later. Weed species clustered into three tillage timing groups at the two New York locations and clustered into five tillage timing groups at the New Hampshire and Maine locations. Individual species associated with each window of tillage time varied by location. No single trait or combination of traits were consistently associated with species-by-tillage time groupings across locations; however, within each location several traits were associated with particular groups of species, including: (a) seed length, (b) seed weight, (c) cotyledon type, (d) life span, (e) ploidy level and (f) photosynthetic pathway. These results suggest that fine-scale variation in the timing of tillage can lead to predictable changes in the species composition and trait distribution of weed communities in annually tilled agroecosystems.},

Glyphosate-resistant (GR) technology is one such weed management practice now used extensively. A recent survey of weed scientists was conducted to address weed shifts in GR corn, cotton, and soybean. Twelve scientists in 11 states responded to the survey. Averaged over estimates from scientists, GR corn, cotton, and soybean were planted on 15, 90, and 88\% of the hectarage in 2003, respectively. Acreage of GR corn is expected to rise, whereas only minor changes in acreage of GR cotton or soybean are expected. Weed shifts have not been observed in GR corn but have occurred in GR cotton and soybean. In GR cotton, Amaranthus, Commelina, Ipomoea, and Cyperus species as well as annual grasses were noted as becoming more problematic. Similar to cotton, Ipomoea and Commelina species are becoming more troublesome in GR soybean. In addition, in GR soybean, various winter annuals, lambsquarters species, and waterhemp species were noted as becoming more problematic. All scientists felt that weeds shifts were occurring, and two-thirds of these scientists noted that weed shifts are currently of economic concern. The scientists recommend the following to help manage weed shifts: additional herbicides in mixture with glyphosate, rotation to herbicides other than glyphosate, rotation to non-GR crops, and greater use of soil-applied herbicides.]},

  abstract = {The soil conservation movement in Brazil has been a major driving force in the continuing search for agricultural farming systems that are more sustainable than what we have today, particularly in tropical and subtropical areas. The development and adoption of Zero Tillage Conservation Agriculture (ZT/CA) was the key to the success of this movement, generating agricultural, environmental, and societal benefits. Adoption of the ZT/CA philosophy and technologies is currently practiced on more than 50\% of the annual crop area. This is due to the work and innovations of pioneering farmers, agronomists, researchers, and consultants that were and are involved in these efforts. This extensive adoption of ZT/CA occurred after many unsuccessful efforts to mitigate against the devastating effects of soil erosion that were threatening the entire agricultural industry in Brazil. Technicians and farmers realized that erosion control required continual cover of the soil to guard against the torrential rain storms common to these regions. This triggered the efforts of soil conservation pioneers at different points in time and regions of Brazil. In southern Brazil, Herbert Bartz, watched his topsoil eroding away in torrents of runoff. This set him thinking and searching for alternatives, resulting in his adoption of ZT/CA farming in 1972. Ten years later in Brazil's centre-western savannah (Cerrado biome), farmers, researchers, crop consultants and agro-industry initiated efforts to expand cultivation into the very difficult production region of the Cerrados. This was successfully achieved through the pioneering work of agronomist John Landers, bringing experience from the ZT/CA farmer association networks in the south. These were the turning points in the sustainable development of annual crop farming in Brazil. Today, society recognizes the role of these pioneers as key to achieving social, economic and environmental sustainability. ZT/CA reversed the historically accelerating degradation of soil organic matter and soil structure by abandoning conventional tillage, thus improving soil physical and chemical characteristics. This was achieved by promoting cover cropping and permanent soil cover with crop residues, crop rotations, and complementary, environmentally suitable soil management technologies.},

  abstract = {In the subtropical region of Brazil, integrated crop–livestock systems (ICLSs) are characterized by the annual rotation of pastures and crops in a no-till system where the pasture component is used to produce either meat or milk. These systems focus on integration within the farm rather than between farms, being characterized by alternating cropping and pasturing in the same area. Independent of the crop rotations possible in a subtropical environment, the main integrated farming system found was rotation or succession of summer crops (Glycine max, Zea mays, Phaseolus vulgaris or Oryza sativa) with winter annual grazing grasses (mixed or solely Avena strigosa and Lolium multiflorum) or successive natural pastures. The high variability of crop yield in the Brazilian subtropics (due to climate extremes) as well as associated high costs and low prices has encouraged farmers to integrate livestock into their enterprises as a low-risk diversification option. Long-term experiments have demonstrated the benefits of crop–livestock integration with respect to many aspects of the soil–plant–animal system. There is evidence that such a system is not only a livestock–agriculture combination but also a unique system reaching a new complexity threshold, resulting in emergent properties with novel functionalities, some of which have yet to be investigated. In addition to greater environmental gains with less vulnerability, there are higher yields and more financial gain by the farmer, compared to that in the use of monocultures or non-integrated livestock farming. We conclude that ICLSs in Subtropical Brazil provide the opportunity for intensification with sustainability.},

It was found that under NT, as compared to CT and CP, the total pore volume and coarse pore volume were lower, bulk density in the upper soil layer was higher, available moisture was higher, temperature was lower and infiltrability was higher. Percentage of soil cover was the main factor governing infiltration rate. Without soil cover the infiltration rate under NT was the same as under CP and CT. The use of cover crops and crop rotation had a marked positive effect on maize, soya bean and bean yields. Yields of wheat and soya beans were higher under NT and CP. It is concluded that in Paraná no-tillage in combination with adapted cover crops and crop rotations represents a production system which is efficient in reducing water runoff and consequently soil erosion, and in increasing crop yields.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glyphosate-resistant crops (GRCs) were first introduced in the United States in soybeans in 1996. Adoption has been very rapid in soybeans and cotton since introduction and has grown significantly in maize in recent years. GRCs have grown to over 74 million hectares in five crop species in 13 countries. The intent of this paper is to update the hectares planted and the use patterns of GRC globally, and to discuss briefly future applications and uses of the technology. RESULTS: The largest land areas of GRCs are occupied by soybean (54.2 million ha), maize (13.2 million ha), cotton (5.1 million ha), canola (2.3 million ha) and alfalfa (0.1 million ha). Currently, the USA, Argentina, Brazil and Canada have the largest plantings of GRCs. Herbicide use patterns would indicate that over 50\% of glyphosate-resistant (GR) maize hectares and 70\% of GR cotton hectares receive alternative mode-of-action treatments, while approximately 25\% of GR soybeans receive such a treatment in the USA. Alternative herbicide use is likely driven by both agronomic need and herbicide resistance limitations in certain GR crops such as current GR cotton. Tillage practices in the USA indicate that {$>$} 65\% of GR maize hectares, 70\% of GR cotton hectares and 50\% of GR soybean hectares received some tillage in the production system. Tillage was likely used for multiple purposes ranging from seed-bed preparation to weed management. CONCLUSION: GRCs represent one of the more rapidly adopted weed management technologies in recent history. Current use patterns would indicate that GRCs will likely continue to be a popular weed management choice that may also include the use of other herbicides to complement glyphosate. Stacking with other biotechnology traits will also give farmers the benefits and convenience of multiple pest control and quality trait technologies within a single seed.

  abstract = {Since its commercial introduction in 1974, glyphosate [N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine] has become the dominant herbicide worldwide. There are several reasons for its success. Glyphosate is a highly effective broad-spectrum herbicide, yet it is very toxicologically and environmentally safe. Glyphosate translocates well, and its action is slow enough to take advantage of this. Glyphosate is the only herbicide that targets 5-enolpyruvyl-shikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS), so there are no competing herbicide analogs or classes. Since glyphosate became a generic compound, its cost has dropped dramatically. Perhaps the most important aspect of the success of glyphosate has been the introduction of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant crops in 1996. Almost 90\% of all transgenic crops grown worldwide are glyphosate resistant, and the adoption of these crops is increasing at a steady pace. Glyphosate/glyphosate-resistant crop weed management offers significant environmental and other benefits over the technologies that it replaces. The use of this virtually ideal herbicide is now being threatened by the evolution of glyphosate-resistant weeds. Adoption of resistance management practices will be required to maintain the benefits of glyphosate technologies for future generations. Copyright © 2008 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Herbicides with new modes of action are badly needed to manage the evolution of resistance of weeds to existing herbicides. Yet no major new mode of action has been introduced to the market place for about 20 years. There are probably several reasons for this. New potential products may have remained dormant owing to concerns that glyphosate-resistant (GR) crops have reduced the market for a new herbicide. The capture of a large fraction of the herbicide market by glyphosate with GR crops led to significantly diminished herbicide discovery efforts. Some of the reduced herbicide discovery research was also due to company consolidations and the availability of more generic herbicides. Another problem might be that the best herbicide molecular target sites may have already been discovered. However, target sites that are not utilized, for which there are inhibitors that are highly effective at killing plants, suggests that this is not true. Results of modern methods of target site discovery (e.g. gene knockout methods) are mostly not public, but there is no evidence of good herbicides with new target sites coming from these approaches. In summary, there are several reasons for a long dry period for new herbicide target sites; however, the relative magnitude of each is unclear. The economic stimulus to the herbicide industry caused by the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds, especially GR weeds, may result in one or more new modes of action becoming available in the not too distant future.

  abstract = {Soybeans represent a recent and powerful threat to tropical biodiversity in Brazil. Developing effective strategies to contain and minimize the environmental impact of soybean cultivation requires understanding of both the forces that drive the soybean advance and the many ways that soybeans and their associated infrastructure catalyse destructive processes. The present paper presents an up-to-date review of the advance of soybeans in Brazil, its environmental and social costs and implications for development policy. Soybeans are driven by global market forces, making them different from many of the land-use changes that have dominated the scene in Brazil so far, particularly in Amazonia. Soybeans are much more damaging than other crops because they justify massive transportation infrastructure projects that unleash a chain of events leading to destruction of natural habitats over wide areas in addition to what is directly cultivated for soybeans. The capacity of global markets to absorb additional production represents the most likely limit to the spread of soybeans, although Brazil may someday come to see the need for discouraging rather than subsidizing this crop because many of its effects are unfavourable to national interests, including severe concentration of land tenure and income, expulsion of population to Amazonian frontier, and gold-mining, as well as urban areas, and the opportunity cost of substantial drains on government resources. The multiple impacts of soybean expansion on biodiversity and other development considerations have several implications for policy: (1) protected areas need to be created in advance of soybean frontiers, (2) elimination of the many subsidies that speed soybean expansion beyond what would occur otherwise from market forces is to be encouraged, (3) studies to assess the costs of social and environmental impacts associated with soybean expansion are urgently required, and (4) the environmental-impact regulatory system requires strengthening, including mechanisms for commitments not to implant specific infrastructure projects that are judged to have excessive impacts.},

The survey measured producers' crop history, perception of glyphosate-resistant (GR) weeds, past and present weed pressure, tillage practices, and herbicide use as affected by the adoption of GR crops. This article describes the changes in tillage practice reported in the survey. The adoption of a GR cropping system resulted in a large increase in the percentage of growers using no-till and reduced-till systems. Tillage intensity declined more in continuous GR cotton and GR soybean (45 and 23\%, respectively) than in rotations that included GR corn or non-GR crops. Tillage intensity declined more in the states of Mississippi and North Carolina than in the other states, with 33\% of the growers in these states shifting to more conservative tillage practices after the adoption of a GR crop. This was primarily due to the lower amount of conservation tillage adoption in these states before GR crop availability. Adoption rates of no-till and reduced-till systems increased as farm size decreased. Overall, producers in a crop rotation that included a GR crop shifted from a relatively more tillage-intense system to reduced-till or no-till systems after implementing a GR crop into their production system.},

Locally known as Cerrado, this ecosystem occupies about 20\% of Brazilian territory. Preliminary surveys indicate that at least 50 × 106 ha of the Cerrado are of potential use for intensive mechanized agriculture, but development has been limited by soil-related constraints. Most soils are acid and with very low native fertility, especially in terms of phosphorus. Chemical barriers to root growth may cause severe yield losses during dry periods. Field crop responses to lime and fertilizers, obtained during the last 5–8 years, show that once soil-related constraints are removed, high yields can be achieved. This review gives an account of the main lines of research which are leading to economic methods of developing the agricultural use of the Cerrado, and gives future research needs.},

Researchers in the United States sought to adapt soybeans to lower latitudes to provide southern poultry farmers with a local high-quality protein meal. Researchers quickly developed varieties adapted to the longer growing season and warmer climates by focusing on the role of the nighttime photoperiod in soybeans' growth and development. These new varieties became the opening for the Brazilians. Researchers took the low-latitude technology and developed germ plasm that could be deployed in the Southern three states of Brazil: Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, and Parana with a growing climate similar to the Southern United States. Brazil's soybean industry began in the south of the country in the late 1960s, supporting both soybean processing and poultry production. By the 1980s, the federal agricultural research institute, Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuária (EMBRAPA), had advanced the photoperiod line of research even further and successfully adapted soybeans to grow in the tropics at even lower latitudes. Developing this technology opened up soybean production to the West and North regions of the country that lie between 15 degrees south latitude and 5 degrees north latitude. The development of the lowest-latitude varieties begins the real story of the Brazilian soybean complex.},

Many studies highlight the impacts of plant diversification upon pathogens, and the population dynamics of insects and beneficial organism in agricultural ecosystems. These studies provide evidence that habitat manipulation techniques such as intercropping, relay, and rotation can significantly improve disease and pest management. This review introduces the concept of crop diversity, considers recent insights and mechanisms underlying crop diversity, and discusses its potential for improving sustainable agricultural practices. Recently, the phytobiomes resulting from increased crop diversity are increasingly recognized for their contribution to disease and pest control. Further, understanding the interactions between pathogens or pests with their host phytobiome may lead to novel options for the prevention of pests. Recent advances in the agricultural systems include: (i) a better understanding of the mechanisms of interactions between crop species and genotypes; (ii) ecological progress including a better understanding of the context-dependency of those interactions; and (iii) the role of microtopographic variation in agricultural systems for priming basal resistance to multiple pests and pathogens by intercropped crops. We also highlight recent progress in China and the potential options for habitat management and design that enhance the ecological role of biodiversity in agroecosystems.},

  abstract = {Glyphosate is the most widely used and successful herbicide discovered to date, but its utility is now threatened by the occurrence of several glyphosate-resistant weed species. Glyphosate resistance first appeared in Lolium rigidum in an apple orchard in Australia in 1996, ironically the year that the first glyphosate-resistant crop (soybean) was introduced in the USA. Thirty-eight weed species have now evolved resistance to glyphosate, distributed across 37 countries and in 34 different crops and six non-crop situations. Although glyphosate-resistant weeds have been identified in orchards, vineyards, plantations, cereals, fallow and non-crop situations, it is the glyphosate-resistant weeds in glyphosate-resistant crop systems that dominate the area infested and growing economic impact. Glyphosate-resistant weeds present the greatest threat to sustained weed control in major agronomic crops because this herbicide is used to control weeds with resistance to herbicides with other sites of action, and no new herbicide sites of action have been introduced for over 30 years. Industry has responded by developing herbicide resistance traits in major crops that allow existing herbicides to be used in a new way. However, over reliance on these traits will result in multiple-resistance in weeds. Weed control in major crops is at a precarious point, where we must maintain the utility of the herbicides we have until we can transition to new weed management technologies. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

This region has undergone a high degree of typical agricultural development since the early 1970s. Results indicate significant loss of original vegetation as well as high levels of regeneration, suggesting Cerrado vegetation may be more resilient to human impacts than catastrophic estimations suggest.

The discussion concludes that Cerrado land-cover change studied at a higher resolution and larger scales (smaller area) is required to represent more effectively the complexity of land conversion for better assessment of human impacts and environmental policy.},

Dicamba-resistant (DR) cotton became available in 2015, followed by DR soybean in 2016; in late 2016 came the release of new dicamba formulations approved for topical use in cotton and soybeans. Until this approval, use of dicamba was limited to primarily corn, small grains, range and pasture, and eco-fallow acres. Hence, studies were conducted in 2015 and 2016 to examine off-target movement of two dicamba formulations using non-DR soybean as a bio-indicator. Diglycolamine (DGA) and N,N-Bis(3-aminopropyl)methylamine (BAPMA) dicamba were applied simultaneously at 560 g ae ha–1 in the center of two side-by-side 8-ha fields to vegetative glufosinate-resistant soybean. On the same day, a rate response experiment was established encompassing nine different dicamba rates of each formulation. Results from the rate response experiment indicate that soybean is equally sensitive to DGA and BAPMA dicamba. In 2015, a rain event occurring 6 to 8 h after application of the large drift trial probably limited off-target movement by incorporating some of the herbicide into the soil. As a result, secondary drift was less in 2015 than in 2016. However, minimal secondary injury ({$<$}5\%) occurred 12 m farther into DGA dicamba plots in 2015. In 2016, secondary movement was decreased by 72 m when BAPMA dicamba was used compared to DGA dicamba. Appreciable secondary movement of both DGA and BAPMA dicamba is possible following in-crop applications of either formulated product to soybean in early to mid-summer. Additionally, the risk for secondary movement of BAPMA dicamba is slightly less than for DGA dicamba.},

The Cerrado has the richest flora among the world's savannas ({$>$}7000 species) and high levels of endemism. Species richness of birds, fishes, reptiles, amphibians, and insects is equally high, whereas mammal diversity is relatively low. Deforestation rates have been higher in the Cerrado than in the Amazon rainforest, and conservation efforts have been modest: only 2.2\% of its area is under legal protection. Numerous animal and plant species are threatened with extinction, and an estimated 20\% of threatened and endemic species do not occur in protected areas. Soil erosion, the degradation of the diverse Cerrado vegetation formations, and the spread of exotic grasses are widespread and major threats. The use of fire for clearing land and to encourage new growth for pasture has also caused damage, even though the Cerrado is a fire-adapted ecosystem. Ecosystem experiments and modeling show that change in land cover is altering the hydrology and affecting carbon stocks and fluxes. Cerrado agriculture is lucrative, and agricultural expansion is expected to continue, requiring improvements in and extension of the transportation infrastructure, which will affect not only the Cerrado but also the Amazon forest. Large-scale landscape modification and threats to numerous species have led to renewed interest from various sectors in promoting the conservation of the Cerrado, particularly through strengthening and enlarging the system of protected areas and improving farming practices and thus the livelihoods of local communities.},

  abstract = {There is Agro-climatic concern that the widespread use of dicamba-based herbicides in Dicamba-Tolerant (DT) soybeans can result in un-intended drift onto non-DT crops in nearby field due to windy conditions and volatility. New dicamba-based products such as Engenia® and XtendiMax® with Vapor Grip technology were developed to reduce volatility, however, they are not completely volatile-free. A study was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of pot-grown grape and tomato to six micro-rates of three dicamba-based products (Clarity®, Engenia® and XtendiMax®) in 2016 and 2017, at Haskell Ag Lab, Concord (42.37oN, 96.68oW), NE, USA. The tested dicamba formulations negatively impacted growth of grape and tomato as measured by vine length and plant height respectively, as well as by plant biomass. About 2\% of the label rate was high enough to cause 50\% injury and reduction in vine length or plant height. For example, a dose of 6.54 to 9.13 g ae ha-1 and 3.98 to 5.35 g ae ha-1 caused 50\% injury in grape and tomato respectively, at 21 DAT. At 50\% injury and vine reduction threshold, grape appeared more sensitive to XtendiMax® than Clarity® and Engenia®. For instance, a dose of 1.83 g ae ha-1 of XtendiMax® was required to cause 50\% reduction in vine length (\textasciitilde{}49 cm) compared to significantly higher dose of 5.64 and 7.59 g ae ha-1 required for Clarity® and Engenia®, respectively. However, in tomato, there was no significant difference in sensitivity to all three products. In general, the present study showed that grape and tomato were very sensitive to micro-rates of all three dicamba products, irrespective of the of the new dicamba technology that reduces volatility. Hence, efforts should be made to avoid drift of dicamba onto these crops.},

All studies that included visible injury data (N = 7) reported injury symptoms at the lowest nonzero dicamba dose applied (as low as 0.03 g ae ha − 1), and therefore a NOED could not be estimated from the existing peerreviewed literature. Based on statistical tests for hormesis, there is insufficient evidence to support any claim of increased soybean yield at low dicamba doses. Future research should include a range of dicamba doses lower than 0.03 g ha − 1 to estimate a NOED and determine whether a hormesis effect is possible at or below dicamba doses that cause visible injury symptoms. Soybean is more susceptible to dicamba when exposed at flowering (R1 to R2 stage) compared with vegetative stages (V1 to V7). A dicamba dose of 0.9 g ha − 1 (95\% CI = 0.08 to 1.7) at the flowering stage was estimated to cause 5\% soybean yield loss. When exposed at vegetative stages, dicamba doses that cause less than 30\% visible injury symptoms (95\% CI = 23 to 49\%) appear unlikely to cause greater than 5\% soybean yield loss; however, if soybean is exposed at flowering, visible injury symptoms greater than 12\% (95\% CI = 8 to 16\%) are likely to be associated with at least 5\% soybean yield loss.},

Palmer amaranth populations in Brazil were very difficult to control using glyphosate, which resulted in many changes to standard weed management practices. A genotyping assay was used to confirm that the population detected in Mato Grosso State, Brazil, was correctly identified as Palmer amaranth and that it was not tall waterhemp. Greenhouse dose–response curves and shikimate accumulation assays showed that the Brazilian population was highly resistant to glyphosate, with an LD50 value (3,982 g glyphosate ha−1) more than twice the typical use rates and very little shikimate accumulation at 1 mM glyphosate concentrations in a leaf-disk assay. The Brazilian population was also resistant to sulfonylurea and imidazolinone acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibitor herbicides. The resistance mechanisms in the Brazilian population were identified as increased EPSPS gene copy number for glyphosate resistance (between 50- and 179-fold relative EPSPS gene copy number increase) and two different alleles for target-site mutations in the ALS gene (W574L and S653N). These results confirm the introduction of Palmer amaranth to Brazil using a genetic marker for species identification, as well as resistance to glyphosate and ALS inhibitors.},

Despite the relevance of this topic, few studies have evaluated the dispersal of these species in Brazil. The objective of this study was to evaluate the dispersal and frequency of known GR and glyphosate-tolerant weeds in soybean-producing microregions. A total of 2,481 interviews were conducted in different regions of Brazil. The interviews were stratified among 20 edaphoclimatic microregions (ECRs) to cover all of the country's soybean-producing regions. A minimum number of interviews was estimated to generate a margin of error of ≤⃒10\% within the ECRs and ≤⃒5\% in the country. The values of the farmers' responses were extrapolated to the total soybean production area of each ECR and the country as a whole, and the absolute values of each response were normalized as percentage values. The dispersal and management data demonstrate a loss of efficiency of glyphosate-resistance technology. Species that are naturally tolerant to glyphosate such as goosegrass, Commelina spp., and Ipomoea spp. had a greater presence in the ECRs, as did the resistant biotypes, particularly Conyza spp. and sourgrass, due to the large area cultivated with GR soybean, where glyphosate has been used with high frequency.Nomenclature: Glyphosate; dayflower species, Commelina spp.; goosegrass, Eleusine indica (L.)

The rate at which weed population shifts occur depends on the selection pressure imposed, genetic variability among weed populations, plant characteristics and environmental factors. Agronomic practices associated with cropping systems including crop rotation, tillage, herbicide use, soil amendments, and mechanization of harvesting that impart a range of selection pressures on weed populations are discussed in this review. Widespread use of herbicides has had the greatest impact on weed selection in recent years. Evolution of herbicide resistant weeds presents an enormous challenge to farmers. Development of herbicide tolerant crops has provided another tool for farmers however the selection pressure on weeds and potential impact on weed population shifts will require judicious use of this technology. Simulation models provide an excellent opportunity to predict future weed population shifts in response to management practices. Further insight into future management changes on weed selection must proceed towards an investigation of the processes rather than the outcomes. In particular, this must involve an understanding of the ecological factors and processes that are likely to determine the weed responses to particular management regimes.},

Yet the US dollar and North Atlantic transnational companies still control global soybean markets and production technologies. In a context marked by booming but volatile commodity prices, food crises, riots and revolutions in food-importing countries, a global rush for farmland, and severe droughts and climate change, the soybean agribusiness in Brazil takes on new and crucial geopolitical significance.

Field studies were conducted to evaluate glyphosate (N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine))–resistant (GR) soybean response to micro-rates (0, 1/1000, 1/500, 1/100, 1/50, and 1/10 of the label rate, 560 g a.e. ha-1) of the two new dicamba products compared with Clarity (diglycolamine salt) applied at three growth stages. The GR soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] was equally impacted by the micro-rates of all three products as measured by visual injury, height reduction, delayed physiological maturity, and yield reduction. The greatest visual injury (80\%), plant height reduction (65\%), maturity delay (22 d), and soybean yield loss (96\%) was caused by 1/10 of the dicamba label rate when applied at V7/R1 soybean growth stage. In addition, estimation of effective dose for 5, 10, or 20\% yield reduction suggested that V7/R1 was the most sensitive soybean growth stage to the three dicamba products. For example, 10\% yield reduction occurred when 1.83 to 1.85 g a.e. ha-1 (\textasciitilde{}1/300 of the label rate) of Engenia was applied at V2 or R2, whereas, a lower dose of 0.32 g a.e. ha-1 (1/1750 of the label rate) of Engenia caused the same level of yield reduction when applied at V7/R1. Similar doses were estimated for Clarity and XtendiMax; therefore dicamba drift should be avoided at all costs, because GR soybean was equally sensitive to low rates of all three tested products with different formulations or technologies.},

Nonetheless, there is not much information related to the frequency and dispersion of sourgrass throughout recent years. We investigated the frequency and dispersion of glyphosate-resistant sourgrass populations in Brazilian agricultural regions as part of a larger-scale weed resistance monitoring study. A discriminatory rate of 960 g ae ha−1 of glyphosate was used on plants at the 2- to 3-tiller stage, originating from 2,593 populations of sourgrass sampled in 329 counties in 14 Brazilian states between 2012 and 2015. The dispersion of sourgrass populations originated in western Paraná State, next to the Paraguay border, where the first resistance case was reported. Its dispersion to the central region of Brazil, mainly in soybean-producing areas, is most likely a consequence of agricultural equipment movement and wind-mediated dispersal. Glyphosate-resistant sourgrass populations were found in every geographical region across all Brazilian states tested. These data highlight the importance of an appropriate weed resistance monitoring program to track the evolution and dispersion of resistance to mitigate these issues by focusing efforts regionally and raising awareness among stakeholders in each region.Nomenclature: glyphosate, sourgrass, Digitaria insularis (L.)

Field experiments were conducted in 2014 and 2015 at the Arkansas Agricultural Research and Extension Center to evaluate various cover crops for suppressing weed emergence and protecting cotton yield. In both years, cereal rye and wheat had the highest biomass production, whereas the amount of biomass present in spring did not differ among the remaining cover crops. All cover crops initially diminished Palmer amaranth emergence. However, cereal rye provided the greatest suppression, with 83\% less emergence than in no cover crop plots. Physical suppression of Palmer amaranth and other weeds with cereal residues is probably the greatest contributor to reducing weed emergence. Seed cotton yield in the legume and rapeseed cover crop plots were similar when compared with the no cover crop treatment. The seed cotton yield collected from cereal cover crop plots was lower than from other treatments due to decreased cotton stand.},

Since that time there has been a consistent increase in the number of cases of herbicide resistance and the impact of herbicide-resistant weeds. Although the nature of crop production varies widely around the world, herbicides have become a primary tool for weed control in most areas. Dependence on herbicides continues to increase as global populations migrate away from rural areas to cities and the agricultural labor force declines. This increased use of herbicides and the concurrent selection pressure have resulted in a rise in cases of multiple resistance, leaving some farmers with few or no herbicide options for certain weed infestations. Global population and economic forces drive many farmer choices regarding crop production and weed control. The challenge is how to insert best management practices into the decision-making process while addressing various economic and regulatory needs. This review endeavors to provide a current overview of herbicide resistance challenges in the major crop production areas of the world and discusses some research initiatives designed to address portions of the problem. © 2017 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Foram realizados dois estudos (em campo e em casa de vegetação) com sementes de capim arroz da Depressão Central do Rio Grande do Sul, coletadas em áreas de produção de soja com objetivo de avaliar possível resistência ao herbicida glifosato. Estes estudos, conduzidos durante dois ciclos consecutivos da cultura da soja, mostram a ocorrência de biótipo de capim arroz coloninho (Echinochloa colona) resistente ao herbicida glifosato. Para comprovar a hipótese, foram realizadas curvas dose-resposta com o herbicida glifosato, comparando um biótipo suscetível coletado em Itaqui/RS e um biótipo suspeito de resistência de Santa Maria/RS. As
doses de glifosato avaliadas variaram em: zero, 2, 4, 8, 16 e 32 L.ha-1. O delineamento experimental foi de blocos ao acaso com 4 repetições. O biótipo considerado resistente apresentou um fator de resistência de 4,54 portanto, teoricamente, necessita de dose pelo menos cinco vezes maior do que aquela que provoca perda de 50\% da massa seca da parte aérea no biótipo suscetível. Entretanto, apesar de ser considerada academicamente como baixo nível de resistência, o mesmo estudo realizado em casa de vegetação foi conduzido em campo, também durante dois ciclos da cultura da soja, revelando que o controle em nível considerado satisfatório (maior que 80\%) foi obtido com doses de glifosato superiores a 12 litros por hectare, quando aplicadas em capim arroz com 1-2 perfilhos. Obteve-se controle deste biótipo resistente e do
biótipo suscetível avaliados, com a aplicação do herbicida Cletodim na dose de 800 ml.ha-1.},

  abstract = {Glyphosate resistance was first discovered in populations of rigid ryegrass in Australia in 1996. Since then, glyphosate resistance has been detected in additional populations of rigid ryegrass and Italian ryegrass in several other countries. Glyphosate-resistant rigid ryegrass and Italian ryegrass have been selected in situations where there is an overreliance on glyphosate to the exclusion of other weed control tactics. Two major mechanisms of glyphosate resistance have been discovered in these two species: a change in the pattern of glyphosate translocation such that glyphosate accumulates in the leaf tips of resistant plants instead of in the shoot meristem; and amino acid substitutions at Pro 106 within the target site, 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS). There are also populations with both mechanisms. In the case of glyphosate resistance, the target site mutations tend to provide a lower level of resistance than does the altered translocation mechanism. Each of these resistance mechanisms is inherited as a single gene trait that is largely dominant. As these ryegrass species are obligate outcrossers, this ensures resistance alleles can move in both pollen and seed. Some glyphosate-resistant rigid ryegrass populations appear to have a significant fitness penalty associated with the resistance allele. Field surveys show that strategies vary in their ability to reduce the frequency of glyphosate resistance in populations and weed population size, with integrated strategies—including alternative weed management and controlling seed set of surviving plants—the most effective.Nomenclature: Glyphosate; rigid ryegrass, Lolium rigidum Gaud.

  abstract = {In this research we consider the impact of export-driven, soybean agriculture in Mato Grosso on regional economic growth. Here we argue that the soybean sector has served as a motor to the state’s economy by increasing the demand for services, housing, and goods, and by providing a source of investment capital to the non-agricultural sector. Specifically, we show that each square kilometer of soybean production supports 2.5 formal sector jobs outside of agriculture, and the equivalent of approximately 150,000US in annual, non-agricultural GDP. We also show that annual gains in non-agricultural employment and GDP are closely tied to soybean profitability, and thus vary from year to year. However, while this article highlights the potential of the agricultural sector as a driver of regional economic growth, it also acknowledges that this growth has been sustained by profits determined by externally set prices and the rate of exchange, and that future growth trajectories will be susceptible to potential currency of market shocks. We also show that while Mato Grosso’s economic growth has come at a significant cost to the environment, value added by the agriculture sector, directly and indirectly, has surpassed the value of the CO2-e emitted through land clearings.},

Almost all the land use change, for the sugarcane expansion of crop year 2008/09, occurred on pasture and annual crop land, being equally distributed on each. It was also observed that during the 2008 harvest season, the burned sugarcane area was reduced to 50\% of the total harvested area in response to a protocol that aims to cease sugarcane straw burning practice by 2014 for mechanized areas. This study indicates that remote sensing images have efficiently evaluated important characteristics of the sugarcane cultivation dynamic providing quantitative results that are relevant to the debate of sustainable ethanol production from sugarcane in Brazil.},

Plants were collected, identified as Conyza sumatrensis and subsequently evaluated for possible resistance to glyphosate in four stages of weed development. The experiments were carried out in a greenhouse by combining biotypes, stages of development and a range of glyphosate doses. All the suspected biotypes were collected from locations in Cascavel, Toledo, Assis Chateaubriand, Tupãssi and Campo Mourão with a history of glyphosate use in burndown and in glyphosate-resistant soybean for at least the four previous years and were compared to a susceptible biotype (São Jorge do Ivaí) with no previous history of herbicide use. The doses of glyphosate ranged from 0 to 5760 g ae ha−1. The biotypes were considered as resistant if two combined criteria were present (resistance factor {$>$} 1 and the rate required to achieve 80\% control is {$>$}720 g ha−1). The results provided evidence that there is a marked difference in the level of control of older plants and also confirmed the presence of some resistant biotypes. For applications at the first stage of development, two biotypes that were resistant to glyphosate were identified (Cascavel-1 and Tupãssi-6). For applications in the second stage of development, beyond the biotypes that were found in the first stage, three other biotypes were considered as resistant: Toledo-5, Assis Chateaubriand-7 and Floresta-10. However, for applications at the third and fourth stages, all the biotypes were considered as resistant.},

Although 94\% of the consultants determined that glufosinate was most effective on killing Palmer amaranth, the primary concern associated with controlling herbicide-resistant weeds was the associated cost, followed by return profit and time constraints. Palmer amaranth, morningglory species, horseweed, barnyardgrass, and Italian ryegrass were the five most problematic weeds in soybean across the five states. Palmer amaranth was the most problematic and important weed in each state individually. The increased concern (77\% of consultants) with this species was attributed to the rising concern with and occurrence of protoporphyrinogen oxidase–resistant Palmer amaranth. Consultants were of the opinion that more research was needed on cover crops and the new traited technologies in order to improve weed management in soybean.},

Fleabane, pigweed, johnsongrass, fingergrass, goosegrass, barnyardgrass, and ryegrass were considered the most important weeds. More than 53\% of the producers used only chemical options; 86\% used chemical fallow (i.e., keeping weed free with chemical application); 62\% used full herbicide rates; 46\% used proper herbicide timing; 41\% used multiple modes of action; and 32\% used rotation of herbicide modes of action. The main nonchemical practices used were crop rotation (45\%); avoiding seed production during (31\%) and after (25\%) the crop cycle; narrow row spacing (19\%); and cultivars with greater competitive ability (18\%). Less than 15\% of the people surveyed used increased crop densities or altered date of sowing. There is a high dependence on chemical control in the main crops grown in Argentina.

  abstract = {Horseweed is a winter or summer annual plant, native to North America and distributed worldwide in temperate climates. This plant is considered an important agricultural weed because it can reduce agricultural yields by 90\% at high densities and becomes problematic under low-tillage agriculture. Seed production is robust with an estimated 200,000 seeds produced per plant, and seed dispersal is wind-assisted. The confirmation of glyphosate-resistant horseweed in Delaware in 2001 and the rapid spread of the resistant biotype, currently covering more than 44,000 ha, has necessitated a change in the discussion about weed dispersal. Large radio-controlled airplanes were used to sample the lower atmosphere for the presence of horseweed seeds during a 3-d period in early September 2005 in southern Delaware. The collection of multiple seeds at heights ranging from 41 to 140 m above ground level strongly suggests that horseweed seeds are entering the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) of the atmosphere, where long-ranged transport of aerial biota frequently occurs. With wind speeds in the PBL frequently exceeding 20 m s−1, seed dispersal can easily exceed 500 km in a single dispersal event.},

This paper studies the expansion of agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon from 1976 to 2001 based on the eight most important products (cattle, bananas, beans, cassava, coffee, maize, rice and soybeans). A biological delimitation of the Amazon based on a map of Brazil's biomes was adopted in order to avoid inclusion of non-forested areas in the analysis. Intense spatial changes in Brazilian agriculture have occurred, with the emergence of new production centres for soybeans and cattle. Several of these regions are located nearby or inside the Amazon's limits. Livestock and soybean cropping in Brazil are consistently moving north. The contribution of the Amazon to Brazilian agriculture rose significantly during the last decades, reaching 28.9\% of cassava, 21.3\% of banana, 14.2\% of rice and 20.0\% of cattle production in Brazil in 2001 (three-year average). Cropped area and production in the Amazon have grown at higher annual rates than in the rest of the country for almost all items analysed, supporting the view that the region is a new frontier of Brazilian agriculture. Most recent trends point to a vigorous demand for new land, which will consequently imply a predicted increase in forest clearing.},

We found (i) minor illegal land use in protected areas under public administration, (ii) a large deficit in legal reserves and protected riparian zones on private farmland, and (iii) large areas of unprotected natural vegetation in regions experiencing agriculture expansion. Achieving full compliance with the environmental laws as they presently stand would require drastic changes in agricultural land use, where large agricultural areas are taken out of production and converted back to natural vegetation. The outcome of a full compliance with environmental legislation might not be satisfactory due to leakage, where pristine unprotected areas become converted to compensate for lost production as current agricultural areas are reconverted to protected natural vegetation. Realizing the desired protection of biodiversity and natural vegetation, while expanding agriculture to meet food and biofuel demand, may require a new approach to environmental protection. New legal and regulatory instruments and the establishment of alternative development models should be considered.},

A 9-yr study from 1988 to 1996 was conducted at Delhi, Ontario, on a loamy sand soil to evaluate the effect of tillage systems (conventional [CT] and no-till [NT]), cover crop Secale cereale, and nitrogen (N) rate (0, 50, 100, 125, 150, and 200 kg N ha⁻¹) on monocrop Zea mays L. (corn) yield and changes in the composition of the weed flora. CT consisted of spring moldboard plowing followed by cultivation with a tooth cultivator. Weed counts were taken in the last 3 yr of the study (1994, 1995, and 1996) prior to postemergence herbicide application and then again 2 to 3 wk after herbicide treatment. Composition of the weed flora was analyzed by canonical discriminant analysis (CDA). The relationship between weed density and tillage system was not consistent. Weed species composition differed between CT and NT systems. Chenopodium album and Amaranthus retroflexus were associated with CT and Digitaria sanguinalis with NT. N rate and cover crop did not affect weed density or species composition. Proper management of weeds with herbicides appeared to minimize any long-term effect on the weed flora resulting from varying N rates. Zea mays yields did not differ between CT and NT systems but were greater in both systems with a cover crop at the higher N rates. Disturbance caused by tillage was more important than N rate and cover crop as a mechanism influencing composition of the weed flora.]},

This study elucidated the resistance mechanism in this species and developed a molecular marker for rapid detection of this target-site resistance trait. The resistance factor for the resistant biotype was 4.4-fold compared with the glyphosate-susceptible (GS) in greenhouse dose–response experiments. This was accompanied by a similar (4-fold) difference in the levels of in vitro and in planta shikimate accumulation in these biotypes. However, there was no difference in uptake, translocation, or metabolism of glyphosate between the GS and GR biotypes. Moreover, both biotypes showed similar values for 5-enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSPS) copy number and transcription. Sequencing of a 330-bp fragment of the EPSPS gene identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism that led to a Pro-106-Ser amino acid substitution in the enzyme from the GR biotype. This mutation imparted a 3.8-fold increase in the amount of glyphosate required to inhibit 50\% of EPSPS activity, confirming the role of this amino acid substitution in resistance to glyphosate. A quantitative PCR–based genotyping assay was developed for the rapid detection of resistant plants containing this Pro-106-Ser mutation.},

The hypothesis of this research is that the evolution of these resistant populations might have occurred independently. To test this hypothesis, a dose–response experiment was conducted in order to confirm resistance and inter simple sequence repeat markers subsequently were evaluated in five sourgrass populations from Paraguay (PY-R), Paraná (PR-S and PR-R), and São Paulo (SP-S and SP-R). Resistant populations were confirmed in PY-R, PR-R and SP-R. The resistant populations presented lower polymorphism than susceptible populations, possibly related to the selection pressure exerted by the herbicide. Both similarity matrix and dendrogram provided evidences that the origin of resistance in the populations from Paraguay and Paraná could be the same, which also is explained by their geographical proximity. In contrast, the evolution of GR populations in São Paulo was suggested to occur independently from other locations because resistance evolved in genetically divergent populations. This study’s data provide evidences that GR sourgrass populations from Paraguay and Paraná share a similar genetic background; therefore, it is possible that resistance from Paraguay spread to Paraná through gene flow. The population from São Paulo probably was selected independently because the high values of its genetic structure and low level of gene flow. Independent selections and seed dispersion of GR sourgrass have contributed to the rapid spread of resistance across South America.},

  abstract = {Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion. Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100–110\% increase in global crop demand from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, ∼1 billion ha of land would be cleared globally by 2050, with CO2-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching ∼3 Gt y−1 and N use ∼250 Mt y−1 by then. In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands, and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only ∼0.2 billion ha, greenhouse gas emissions of ∼1 Gt y−1, and global N use of ∼225 Mt y−1. Efficient management practices could substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.},

The weed spectrum changed rapidly in non-tillage plots. With time, in the absence of tillage, grassy annual populations increased in the maize/soyabean rotation, and wind-dispersed weed populations increased in the wheat/soyabean rotation. Perennial weeds showed an inconsistent behaviour in relation to tillage systems in the maize/soyabean rotation.},

This work evaluates the distribution of ALS-resistant E. heterophylla in two states in southern Brazil and determines the major contributing management causes for weed resistance selection in the area. E. heterophylla seeds from 148 sites located in Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul were sampled during 2001 and 2002. Farmers provided specific site data for weed control, tillage system, crop rotation and harvesting operations during previous years. ALS resistant E. heterophylla biotypes were found widely distributed in the survey area. Data analysis suggests seed dissemination is unlikely to explain the widespread distribution of resistance. The most probable factor for the selection of the resistant E. heterophylla is the persistent high use of ALS-inhibiting herbicides over time. Indirect evidence is presented demonstrating the need to educate legislators and farmers about the importance of herbicide mixtures as a strategy to prevent herbicide resistance.},

Alternatives or adjuncts to herbicides are needed for sustainable control of crop weeds in grain crops worldwide. Here we introduce and prove the ability of a new weed control tool, the Harrington Seed Destructor (HSD), to intercept and destroy weed seeds during grain crop harvest. The interception and destruction of weed seeds exiting the grain harvester in the chaff fraction during grain crop harvest is a hitherto unrealized opportunity. We have developed a cage millbased chaff processing unit that consistently destroys weed seed infesting grain crop chaff fractions. The subsequent construction of the HSD incorporating this unit had {$>$}95\% weed seed destruction efficacy when used during commercial harvest of three major grain crops, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.). The HSD system has the potential for a dramatic impact on global grain production by providing the unique combination of effective weed control with complete retention of grain crop harvest residues. Only herbicides offer this same combination of highly effective weed control and complete residue retention in large scale grain crop production systems.},

In August and September of 2017, a survey of 312 farmers from 60 Nebraska soybean-producing counties was conducted during extension field days or online. The objective of this survey was to understand farmers’ adoption and perceptions regarding DR soybean technology in Nebraska. The survey contained 16 questions and was divided in three parts: (1) demographics, (2) dicamba application in DR soybean, and (3) dicamba off-target injury to sensitive soybean cultivars. According to the results, 20\% of soybean hectares represented by the survey were planted to DR soybean in 2017, and this number would probably double in 2018. Sixty-five percent of survey respondents own a sprayer and apply their own herbicide programs. More than 90\% of respondents who adopted DR soybean technology reported significant improvement in weed control. Nearly 60\% of respondents used dicamba alone or glyphosate plus dicamba for POST weed control in DR soybean; the remaining 40\% added an additional herbicide with an alternative site of action (SOA) to the POST application. All survey respondents used one of the approved dicamba formulations for application in DR soybean. Survey results indicated that late POST dicamba applications (after late June) were more likely to result in injury to non-DR soybean compared to early POST applications (e.g., May and early June) in 2017. According to respondents, off-target dicamba movement resulted both from applications in DR soybean and dicamba-based herbicides applied in corn. Although 51\% of respondents noted dicamba injury on non-DR soybean, 7\% of those who noted injury filed an official complaint with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Although DR soybean technology allowed farmers to achieve better weed control during 2017 than previous growing seasons, it is apparent that off-target movement and resistance management must be addressed to maintain the viability and effectiveness of the technology in the future.},

  abstract = {[The effect of different levels of tillage and weed management on population, distribution, and germination of weed seed was evaluated in three tillage systems at Arlington and Hancock, WI, in 1989 and 1990. Over 60\% of all weed seed in the top 19 cm of soil were found in the top 1 cm in no-tillage at both sites. As depth increased, concentration of weed seed declined logarithmically in no-tillage. In chisel plowing, over 30\% of seed were in the top 1 cm and seed concentration decreased linearly with depth. Moldboard plowing had uniform distribution of weed seed in the top 19 cm of soil. Preemergence metolachlor plus atrazine decreased weed seed population by 50\% compared with no treatment over all tillage systems. One year of the herbicide treatment plus handweeding to assure weed-free conditions did not reduce seed numbers in chisel plowing or moldboard plowing compared to herbicide alone. Seed numbers with no-tillage and weed-free conditions decreased by 40\% relative to herbicide alone. Common lambsquarters germination was 40\% greater in moldboard plowing and chisel plowing compared with no-tillage. Germination was highest in seed taken from 9 to 19 cm deep in moldboard plowing and from 0 to 9 cm deep in chisel plowing.]},
