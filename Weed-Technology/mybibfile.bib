  abstract = {Field trials were conducted with spring-sown rye and field pea cover crops to determine the effect of five rye-pea proportions and three seeding rates (high, medium, and low) on weed suppression during cover crop growth. Measurements on weed and cover crop growth were taken approximately 2 mo after seeding when cover crops were killed. cover crops were killed by mowing in 1996 and by undercutting in 1997 and 1998. Cover crop biomass, averaged over rye-pea proportion, was highest in 1998 at 4.3 million tons (MT)/ha (high seeding rate) and lowest in 1997 at 1.5 MT/ha (low seeding rate). Cover crops of pure rye or rye-pea mixes suppressed weeds more effectively than did pure pea. Dominant weeds were ladysthumb, smooth pigweed, smallflower galinsoga, and common lambsquarters. Ground cover by weeds ranged from a low of 2\% (rye-pea mixes) to a maximum of 73\% (pure pea). Cover crop mixes of 50\% or more rye seeded at the high rate gave the best weed suppression.},

The BOT of hairy vetch sown in October was significantly higher in February, March, and April than that sown in December.

The fixed C, N, P, and mineral uptake of hairy vetch showed similar patterns to its biomass. The nitrate (NO3-N) content increased from February to May for the soils in the October and December plots, in contrast to the fallow plots. Moreover, the NO3-N and available N of the October and December soils sampled from February to May were higher than that of the fallow soils.

  abstract = {Dormancy is an adaptive trait that enables seed germination to coincide with favorable environmental conditions. It has been clearly demonstrated that dormancy is induced by abscisic acid (ABA) during seed development on the mother plant. After seed dispersal, germination is preceded by a decline in ABA in imbibed seeds, which results from ABA catabolism through 8’-hydroxylation. The hormonal balance between ABA and gibberellins (GAs) has been shown to act as an integrator of environmental cues to maintain dormancy or activate germination. The interplay of ABA with other endogenous signals is however less documented. In numerous species, ethylene counteracts ABA signaling pathways and induces germination. In Brassicaceae seeds, ethylene prevents the inhibitory effects of ABA on endosperm cap weakening, thereby facilitating endosperm rupture and radicle emergence. Moreover, enhanced seed dormancy in Arabidopsis ethylene-insensitive mutants results from greater ABA sensitivity. Conversely, ABA limits ethylene action by down-regulating its biosynthesis. Nitric oxide (NO) has been proposed as a common actor in the ABA and ethylene crosstalk in seed. Indeed, convergent evidence indicates that NO is produced rapidly after seed imbibition and promotes germination by inducing the expression of the ABA 8’-hydroxylase gene, CYP707A2, and stimulating ethylene production. The role of NO and other nitrogen-containing compounds, such as nitrate, in seed dormancy breakage and germination stimulation has been reported in several species. This review will describe our current knowledge of ABA crosstalk with ethylene and NO, both volatile compounds that have been shown to counteract ABA action in seeds and to improve dormancy release and germination.},

  abstract = {Interest in planting mixtures of cover crop species has grown in recent years as farmers seek to increase the breadth of ecosystem services cover crops provide. As part of a multidisciplinary project, we quantified the degree to which monocultures and mixtures of cover crops suppress weeds during the fall-to-spring cover crop growing period. Weed-suppressive cover crop stands can limit weed seed rain from summer- and winter-annual species, reducing weed population growth and ultimately weed pressure in future cash crop stands. We established monocultures and mixtures of two legumes (medium red clover and Austrian winter pea), two grasses (cereal rye and oats), and two brassicas (forage radish and canola) in a long fall growing window following winter wheat harvest and in a shorter window following silage corn harvest. In fall of the long window, grass cover crops and mixtures were the most weed suppressive, whereas legume cover crops were the least weed suppressive. All mixtures also effectively suppressed weeds. This was likely primarily due to the presence of fast-growing grass species, which were effective even when they were seeded at only 20\% of their monoculture rate. In spring, weed biomass was low in all treatments due to winter kill of summer-annual weeds and low germination of winter annuals. In the short window following silage corn, biomass accumulation by cover crops and weeds in the fall was more than an order of magnitude lower than in the longer window. However, there was substantial weed seed production in the spring in all treatments not containing cereal rye (monoculture or mixture). Our results suggest that cover crop mixtures require only low seeding rates of aggressive grass species to provide weed suppression. This creates an opportunity for other species to deliver additional ecosystem services, though careful species selection may be required to maintain mixture diversity and avoid dominance of winter-hardy cover crop grasses in the spring.},

Here, I collate recent research on the herbicide-resistant problem in light of key questions and themes in evolution and ecology. I highlight discoveries made on herbicide-resistant weeds in three broad areas – the genetic basis of adaptation, evolutionary constraints, experimental evolution – and similarly discuss questions left to be answered. I then develop how one would use herbicide-resistance evolution as a model for studying eco-evolutionary dynamics within a community context. My overall goals are to highlight important findings in the weed science literature that are relevant to themes in plant adaptation and to stimulate the use of herbicide-resistant plants as models for addressing key questions within ecology and evolution.},

Given the trend of increasing global temperatures, this sensitivity to higher temperatures poses a challenge for achieving global food security. Early seed development in rice is highly sensitive to unfavorable environmental conditions. Heat stress during this stage decreases seed size and fertility, thus reducing yield. Here, we explored the transgenerational phenotypic consequences of heat stress during early seed development on seed viability, germination, and establishment. To elucidate the impact of heat stress on the developmental events in post-zygotic rice seeds, we imposed moderate (35°C) and severe (39°C) heat stress treatments initiated one day after fertilization and maintained for 24, 48 or 72 h. The transient heat stress treatments altered the initiation of endosperm cellularization, seed size and/or the duration of spikelet ripening. Notably, seeds exposed to 24 and 48 h moderate heat stress exhibited higher germination rate compared to seeds derived from plants grown under control or severe heat stress. A short-term heat stress resulted in altered expression of GA and ABA biosynthesis genes during early seed development, and GA and ABA levels and starch content at maturity. The increased germination rate after 24 of moderate heat stress could be due to altered ABA sensitivity and/or increased starch level. Our findings on the impact of transient heat stress on hormone homeostasis provide an experimental framework to elucidate the underlying molecular and metabolic pathways.},

Then, trends in the use of herbicide for GM crops are studied in the case of the most widespread HT crop: HT soybean in the USA. The trends in the toxicity of herbicides applied to HT soybean are also addressed, as well as the appearance of glyphosate-resistant (GR) weeds. Lastly, the paper examines the spread of GR weeds and its impact. How are farmers, weed scientists, and the industry coping with this development, and what are the prospects of glyphosate-tolerant crops given weed resistance?

A 2-yr study was conducted in Salinas, California, to quantify (1) cover crop and weed biomass production during cover cropping, (2) early-season canopy development of cover crops, (3) weed seed production by burning nettle during cover cropping, and (4) weed emergence following cover crop incorporation. The cover crops included oats, a mustard mix, and a legume/oats mix that were planted in October and soil-incorporated in February. Weed and cover crop densities, early-season cover crop canopy development, above-ground weed and cover crop biomass production, seed production by the burning nettle, and postincorporation weed emergence was evaluated. Mustard produced more early-season biomass than oats and the legume/oats mix. There were no differences in above ground biomass production by the cover crops at the end of their growth period. Suppression of weed biomass and seed production of burning nettle was greatest in mustard, and least in oats and the legume/oats mix. The weed suppressive ability of each cover crop was affected by early-season canopy development and was highly correlated with cover crop plant density. Weed emergence following cover crop incorporation was in order of legume/oats mix {$>$} oats {$>$} mustard in yr 1, but was not different in yr 2. This study provides initial information on cover crop effects on weed management in irrigated and tilled vegetable production systems in the central coast of California.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effect of soil residual pre-emergence (PRE) herbicides followed by (fb) tank-mixture of residual and foliar active post-emergence (POST) herbicides on PS-II- and HPPD-inhibitor-resistant Palmer amaranth control, maize yield, and net economic returns. Field experiments were conducted in a grower’s field infested with PS II- and HPPD-inhibitor-resistant Palmer amaranth near Shickley in Fillmore County, Nebraska, USA in 2015 and 2016. The contrast analysis suggested that saflufenacil plus dimethenamid-P or pyroxasulfone plus saflufenacil applied PRE provided 80 to 82\% Palmer amaranth control compared to 65 and 39\% control with saflufenacil and pyroxasulfone applied alone at 3 weeks after PRE (WAPRE), respectively. Among the PRE fb POST herbicide programs, 95 to 98\% Palmer amaranth control was achieved with pyroxasulfone plus safluefenacil, or saflufenacil plus dimethenamid-P applied PRE, fb glyphosate plus topramezone plus dimethenamid-P plus atrazine, glyphosate plus diflufenzopyr plus dicamba plus pyroxasulfone, glyphosate plus diflufenzopyr plus pendimethalin, or glyphosate plus diflufenzopyr plus dicamba plus atrazine applied POST at 3 weeks after POST (WAPOST) through maize harvest. Based on contrast analysis, PRE fb POST programs provided 77 to 83\% Palmer amaranth control at 3 WAPOST through maize harvest compared to 12 to 15\% control with PRE-only and 66 to 84\% control with POST-only programs. Similarly, PRE fb POST programs provided 99\% biomass reduction at 6 WAPOST compared to PRE-only (28\%) and POST-only (87\%) programs. PRE fb POST programs provided higher maize yield (13,617 kg ha─1) and net return (US \$1,724) compared to the PRE-only (2,656 kg ha─1; US \$285) and POST-only (11,429 kg ha─1; US \$1,539) programs.

Dormancy, the inability to germinate in apparently favorable conditions, has been demonstrated to be regulated by the hormonal balance between abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs). Ethylene plays a key role in dormancy release in numerous species, the effective concentrations allowing the germination of dormant seeds ranging between 0.1 and 200 μL L-1. Studies using inhibitors of ethylene biosynthesis or of ethylene action and analysis of mutant lines altered in genes involved in the ethylene signaling pathway (etr1, ein2, ain1, etr1, and erf1) demonstrate the involvement of ethylene in the regulation of germination and dormancy. Ethylene counteracts ABA effects through a regulation of ABA metabolism and signaling pathways. Moreover, ethylene insensitive mutants in Arabidopsis are more sensitive to ABA and the seeds are more dormant. Numerous data also show an interaction between ABA, GAs and ethylene metabolism and signaling pathways. It has been increasingly demonstrated that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play a significant role in the regulation of seed germination interacting with hormonal signaling pathways. In the present review the responsiveness of seeds to ethylene will be described, and the key role of ethylene in the regulation of seed dormancy via a cross-talk between hormones and other signals will be discussed.},

  abstract = {Undersown cover crop species introduced for weed management purposes should ideally combine adequate weed suppression with only marginal negative competitive effects on the main crop. The aim of this research was to identify the growth characteristics of clover species that determine weed suppressive ability and competitive ability against the main crop. In addition, the variation in these characteristics among clover species was determined, to identify whether species selection is an important component of the optimization of living mulch systems. In 2001, a field experiment was conducted in which weed suppression and competitive ability against leek of eight clover types was determined. Based on the results, three contrasting clover types were selected and their weed suppressive ability was further investigated in a field experiment conducted in 2002. Results of both experiments were related to growth characteristics that were simultaneously determined and described in a previous paper. Correlation analysis showed that the competitive effect of clover on transplanted leek was strongly correlated with maximum canopy height, indicating that yield reduction was mainly caused by competition for light. Subterranean clover, being the shortest species, gave inadequate weed suppression, whereas all other species were found to provide at least reasonable weed suppression. Subterranean clover reduced individual leek plant dry weight more strongly (60\%) than expected based on its canopy height. Indications were found that this clover species was hindering the uptake of nitrogen by leek. Clover species with superior weed suppression, like Persian clover, red clover, alsike clover, berseem clover and crimson clover also gave the strongest negative effect on dry matter accumulation of leek (reductions between 70\% and 90\%). White clover was found to give the best compromise between adequate weed suppression and mild yield reduction, though also with this species reduction in leek plant dry weight was still 60\%. It was concluded that for optimization of systems that introduce clover species as a weed suppressing cover crop species selection is important element, though additional management to restrict the competitive effect on the main crop remains a requirement.},

  abstract = {Three empirical crop yield loss models were used to describe the interference of redroot pigweed and Powell amaranth populations with soybean. Data were obtained from field experiments conducted in 1992 and 1993. Pigweed densities of 0 to eight plants m−1 were established within the soybean row. Pigweed sowing dates were selected so that weed seedling emergence coincided with VE, VC, and V2 soybean growth stages within the time frame of the critical weed-free period. The model incorporating pigweed density and time of emergence gave the best description of soybean yield loss in comparison to the two relative leaf area models. This model was fit to a combined data set of percent yield loss because parameter estimates did not differ among locations and years. Estimated soybean yield losses decreased from 16.4 to 0.5\% with delayed pigweed emergence from 0 to 20 degree days. Leaf area of pigweed relative to soybean encompassed pigweed density and time of emergence. Relationship between relative leaf area and soybean yield loss was best described by the one-parameter model estimating a relative damage coefficient ‘q’ than the two-parameter model that also estimated maximum expected yield loss. The relative damage coefficient ‘q’ decreased with later times of leaf area assessment but could be predicted with one leaf area observation. Empirical models that incorporate time of weed emergence represent a step toward improving predictions of yield loss. This is important for the selection of cost-effective weed control strategies.},

  abstract = {Herbicides with new modes of action are badly needed to manage the evolution of resistance of weeds to existing herbicides. Yet no major new mode of action has been introduced to the market place for about 20 years. There are probably several reasons for this. New potential products may have remained dormant owing to concerns that glyphosate-resistant (GR) crops have reduced the market for a new herbicide. The capture of a large fraction of the herbicide market by glyphosate with GR crops led to significantly diminished herbicide discovery efforts. Some of the reduced herbicide discovery research was also due to company consolidations and the availability of more generic herbicides. Another problem might be that the best herbicide molecular target sites may have already been discovered. However, target sites that are not utilized, for which there are inhibitors that are highly effective at killing plants, suggests that this is not true. Results of modern methods of target site discovery (e.g. gene knockout methods) are mostly not public, but there is no evidence of good herbicides with new target sites coming from these approaches. In summary, there are several reasons for a long dry period for new herbicide target sites; however, the relative magnitude of each is unclear. The economic stimulus to the herbicide industry caused by the evolution of herbicide-resistant weeds, especially GR weeds, may result in one or more new modes of action becoming available in the not too distant future.

Complementary results from field, laboratory, and greenhouse investigations indicate that the CHR population has evolved resistance to herbicides from five sites of action (SOAs): ALS-, PPO-, PSII-, and HPPD-inhibiting herbicides and 2,4-D.

  abstract = {We discuss the dynamics of plant litter, the effects of litter on the chemical and physical environment, the direct and indirect effects of plant litter on plant populations and communities, and different adaptative traits that may be related to litter accumulation. The production of litter depends primarily on the site productivity, but other properties of the environment, as well as chance, may introduce important variation. The existence of time lags between the production of plant organs and their transformation into litter appears as a relevant character of litter dynamics seldom included in models. Herbivory, and other processes that destroy biomass or reduce productivity, may reduce the amount of litter produced. The destruction of litter encompasses a complex of interactions. The main processes, including physical and chemical degradation, consumption by invertebrates and decomposition, are differentially affected by the environment and by the physical and chemical characteristics of the litter itself. The relative importance of those processes varies among systems.Litter alters the physical and chemical environment directly and indirectly. The decomposition of litter may release both nutrients and phytotoxic substances into the soil. The physical changes produced by litter also alter the activity of decomposers, resulting in an indirect effect on the chemical environment. The accumulated litter intercepts light, shading seeds and seedlings, and reduces the thermal amplitude in the soil. By reducing maximum soil temperatures, and creating a barrier to water vapor diffusion, litter reduces evaporation from the soil. However, litter may also diminish water availability when it retains a large proportion of rainfall. Litter creates a physical barrier for seedling and sprout emergence and to seeds reaching the soil.The heterogeneity introduced into the abiotic environment by the patchy accumulation of litter may affect community structure. This effect may be both direct (when the litter of one species affects the performance of a second species) or indirect (when litter produced by one species alters the outcome of the interaction between a second and a third species).Litter tolerance, timing of litterfall to optimize external nutrient recycling, and accumulation of litter to deter competitors (either through physical or chemical effects) have been postulated as strategies associated with litter accumulation. The existing evidence shows that only tolerance to litter accumulation admits adaptative value as the most likely explanation.},

Herbicides replaced the use of millions of workers to pull and hoe weeds by hand and greatly reduced the use of tillage for weed control. Costs of production were reduced and crop yields increased because herbicides were cheaper and more effective than hand weeding and cultivation. Organic crop growers cite weed control as their greatest difficulty in crop production because they are not permitted the use of chemical herbicides. They substitute hand weeding and cultivation for herbicides at a greatly increased cost and with reduced effectiveness. Aggregate studies that estimate the value of herbicides assume that growers would substitute a certain amount of hand weeding and tillage if chemicals were not used, which would not be sufficient to prevent yield losses totaling about 20\% of U.S. crop production.},

Field experiments were conducted on loamy sand soils at two sites in Holt, MI, between 2008 and 2011 to evaluate the relative effects of cereal rye, hairy vetch, and rye–vetch mixture cover crops on the biomass and density of winter annual weed communities. All cover crop treatments significantly reduced total weed biomass compared with a no-cover-crop control, with suppression ranging from 71 to 91\% for vetch to 95 to 98\% for rye. In all trials, the density of nonmustard family broadleaf weeds was either not suppressed or suppressed equally by all cover crop treatments. In contrast, the density of mustard family weed species was suppressed more by rye and rye–vetch mixtures than by vetch. Cover crops were more consistently suppressive of weed dry weight per plant than of weed density, with rye-containing cover crops generally more suppressive than vetch. Overall, rye was most effective at suppressing winter annual weeds; however, rye–vetch mixtures can match the level of control achieved by rye, in addition to providing a potential source of fixed nitrogen for subsequent cash crops.

  abstract = {The perennial and stoloniferous weed, Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers. (bermudagrass), is a serious problem in vineyards. The spectral similarity between bermudagrass and grapevines makes discrimination of the two species, based solely on spectral information from multi-band imaging sensor, unfeasible. However, that challenge can be overcome by use of object-based image analysis (OBIA) and ultra-high spatial resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) images. This research aimed to automatically, accurately, and rapidly map bermudagrass and design maps for its management. Aerial images of two vineyards were captured using two multispectral cameras (RGB and RGNIR) attached to a UAV. First, spectral analysis was performed to select the optimum vegetation index (VI) for bermudagrass discrimination from bare soil. Then, the VI-based OBIA algorithm developed for each camera automatically mapped the grapevines, bermudagrass, and bare soil (accuracies greater than 97.7\%). Finally, site-specific management maps were generated. Combining UAV imagery and a robust OBIA algorithm allowed the automatic mapping of bermudagrass. Analysis of the classified area made it possible to quantify grapevine growth and revealed expansion of bermudagrass infested areas. The generated bermudagrass maps could help farmers improve weed control through a well-programmed strategy. Therefore, the developed OBIA algorithm offers valuable geo-spatial information for designing site-specific bermudagrass management strategies leading farmers to potentially reduce herbicide use as well as optimize fuel, field operating time, and costs.},

  abstract = {Genetically engineered (GE) herbicide-resistant crops have been widely adopted by farmers in the United States and other countries around the world, and these crops have caused significant changes in herbicide use patterns. GE crops have been blamed for increased problems with herbicide-resistant weeds (colloquially called by the misnomer “superweeds”); however, there has been no rigorous analysis of herbicide use or herbicide-resistant weed evolution to quantify the impact of GE crops on herbicide resistance. Here, I analyze data from the International Survey of Herbicide Resistant Weeds and the USDA and demonstrate that adoption of GE corn varieties did not reduce herbicide diversity, and therefore likely did not increase selection pressure for herbicide-resistant weeds in that crop. Adoption of GE herbicide-resistant varieties substantially reduced herbicide diversity in cotton and soybean. Increased glyphosate use in cotton and soybean largely displaced herbicides that are more likely to select for herbicide-resistant weeds, which at least partially mitigated the impact of reduced herbicide diversity. The overall rate of newly confirmed herbicide-resistant weed species to all herbicide sites of action (SOAs) has slowed in the United States since 2005. Although the number of glyphosate-resistant weeds has increased since 1998, the evolution of new glyphosate-resistant weed species as a function of area sprayed has remained relatively low compared with several other commonly used herbicide SOAs.},

In late summer and autumn, the cover crop can suppress growth and seed production of weeds, whereas the incorporation of cover crop residues in spring may reduce or retard weed emergence. Based on these two criteria, six cover crop species were evaluated for their weed suppressive potential in 2 years of experimentation in the Netherlands. Fodder radish, winter oilseed rape and winter rye had the strongest competitive ability in autumn; the competitive strength of Italian ryegrass was intermediate and white lupin and lucerne were poor competitors. Competitiveness was strongly correlated to early light interception. Surprisingly, doubling the recommended sowing density did not increase weed suppressive ability. Although a poor competitor in the fall, after incorporation in spring, lucerne had the strongest inhibitory effect on seedling establishment, followed by winter oilseed rape and white lupin. Winter rye and fodder radish did not affect seedling establishment, whereas Italian ryegrass was not evaluated because of re-growth after incorporation. Competition in autumn and subsequent residue-mediated suppression of weed establishment in spring varied among the cover crop species, with winter oilseed rape offering relatively strong effects during both periods.},

  abstract = {In the conventional cropping systems, increased costs and resource pollution are attributed to the intensive use of chemical inputs. The adoption of cover crops could be a part of a suitable strategy for improving the sustainability of the agro-ecosystems due to their ability to affect nutrient and weed management. A 2-yr field experiments were conducted in Gorgan, North of Iran, with the aim of assessing the effect of cover crop residue management and herbicide rates on weed management and the yield of tomato crop. The treatments consisted in: (a) three winter soil management: two cover crops [annual medic (Medicago scutellata L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)] and no covered soil; (b) two soil tillage (no-tillage, where cover crop residues were left in strips on the soil surface, and conventional tillage, where cover crop residues were green manured at 30 cm of soil depth); and (c) three pre-emergence herbicide rates (no-herbicide application, half rate recommended or full rate recommended ). Cover crops were sown in early September and mechanically suppressed in March about 2 weeks before tomato transplanting. At cover crop suppression, annual medic showed the highest aboveground biomass [569 g m−2 of dry matter (DM)], while barley showed the lowest weed content (32 g m−2 of DM). At tomato harvesting, weed density and aboveground biomass ranged from 6.9 to 61.5 plants m−2 and from 33.6 and 1157.0 g m−2 of DM, respectively. Cover crop residues placed on soil surface suppressed weeds more effectively than incorporated residues, especially in barley, mainly due to the physical barrier of residues which reduced the stimulation of weed germination and establishment. As expected, herbicide rate decreased both weed density and biomass, even if the adoption of annual medic and barley cover crops before the tomato cultivation could allow a possible reduction of herbicide rate while maintaining similar fruit yield. Tomato yield was higher in annual medic than barley and no cover regardless of tillage management (on average 62.3, 51.8 and 50.1 t ha−1 of fresh matter, respectively) probably due to an abundant availability of soil nitrogen throughout the tomato cultivation. This was confirmed by high and constant values of tomato N status grown in annual medic and evaluated using SPAD chlorophyll meter. Although further research of cover crop residue management is required to obtain a better understanding on herbicide rate reduction, these preliminary results could be extended to other vegetable crops which have similar requirements of tomato.},

  abstract = {Cover crop management with a roller/crimper might reduce the need for herbicide. Weed suppression from a rolled cereal rye cover crop was compared to no cover crop with and without postemergence herbicide application in no-till soybean. The experiment was designed as a two-way factorial with rye termination and soybean planting date as the first factor and weed control treatment as the second. Cereal rye was drill-seeded in late September and managed using glyphosate followed by a roller/crimper in the spring. Soybean was no-till seeded after rolling and glyphosate was applied postemergence about 6 wk after planting to half the plots. Rye biomass doubled when delaying rye kill by 10 to 20 d. Weed density and biomass were reduced by the rye cover crop in all site–location combinations except one, but delaying rye kill and soybean planting date only reduced both weed density and biomass at a single location. The cover crop mulch provided weed control similar to the postemergence herbicide in two of four locations. Treatments did not affect soybean grain yield in 2007. In 2008, yield at Landisville with rye alone was equal to those yields receiving the postemergence herbicide, whereas at Rock Springs, it was equivalent or less. The net added cost of a rye cover crop was \$123 ha−1 with or \$68.50 ha−1 without a postemergence herbicide application. A rolled-rye cover crop sometimes provided acceptable weed control, but weed control alone did not justify the use of the cover crop. The potential for reduced herbicide use and other ecosystem services provided by a cover crop justify further refinement and research in this area.

 El manejo de cultivos de cobertera utilizando rodillo podría reducir la necesidad de herbicidas. Se comparó la supresión de la maleza con centeno (Secale cereale L.) como cultivo de cobertera apisonado con rodillo, con un tratamiento sin cobertera con o sin aplicación de herbicida postemergente en un cultivo de soya sin labranza. El experimento se diseñó como factorial de dos vías con la fecha de eliminación del centeno y la siembra de la soya como el primer factor y el tratamiento del control de maleza como el segundo. El centeno fue sembrado con maquinaria a finales de septiembre y tratado con glifosato seguido por el paso de un rodillo en la primavera. La soya se sembró en suelo sin labranza después de pasar el rodillo, y el glifosato se aplicó a la mitad de las parcelas en forma postemergente aproximadamente 6 semanas después de la siembra. La biomasa del centeno se duplicó cuando se retrasó su eliminación química de 10 a 20 días. La densidad y la biomasa de la maleza se redujeron con el uso de centeno en todas las combinaciones sitio-localidad excepto una, pero el retraso en la fecha de eliminación del centeno y la siembra de la soya, sólo disminuyeron la densidad y biomasa de la maleza en una sola localidad. El cultivo de cobertera, proporcionó un control de maleza similar al herbicida postemergente en dos de los cuatro sitios. Los tratamientos no afectaron el rendimiento del grano de soya en 2007. En 2008, el rendimiento en Landisville con sólo centeno fue igual a los rendimientos obtenidos con la aplicación del herbicida postemergente, mientras en Rock Springs fue equivalente o menor. El costo neto adicional de un cultivo de cobertera de centeno fue de \$123 US ha−1 con la aplicación postemergente de herbicida o de \$68.50 US ha−1 sin ella. El cultivo de centeno y uso del rodillo, algunas veces proporcionó un control aceptable de maleza, pero el control de maleza por sí solo no justificó el uso del cultivo de cobertera. El potencial para la reducción en el uso de herbicidas y otros servicios al ecosistema proporcionados por un cultivo de cobertera, justifican mayor refinamiento e investigación en esta área.},

  abstract = {Plant embryos can survive years in a desiccated, quiescent state within seeds. In many species, seeds are dormant and unable to germinate at maturity. They acquire the capacity to germinate through a period of dry storage called after-ripening (AR), a biological process that occurs at 5-15\% moisture when most metabolic processes cease. Because stored transcripts are among the first proteins translated upon water uptake, they likely impact germination potential. Transcriptome changes associated with the increased seed dormancy of the GA-insensitive sly1-2 mutant, and with dormancy loss through long sly1-2 after-ripening (19 months) were characterized in dry seeds. The SLY1 gene was needed for proper down-regulation of translation-associated genes in mature dry seeds, and for AR up-regulation of these genes in germinating seeds. Thus, sly1-2 seed dormancy may result partly from failure to properly regulate protein translation, and partly from observed differences in transcription factor mRNA levels. Two positive regulators of seed dormancy, DELLA GAI (GA-INSENSITIVE) and the histone deacetylase HDA6/SIL1 (MODIFIERS OF SILENCING1) were strongly AR-down-regulated. These transcriptional changes appeared to be functionally relevant since loss of GAI function and application of a histone deacetylase inhibitor led to decreased sly1-2 seed dormancy. Thus, after-ripening may increase germination potential over time by reducing dormancy-promoting stored transcript levels. Differences in transcript accumulation with after-ripening correlated to differences in transcript stability, such that stable mRNAs appeared AR-up-regulated, and unstable transcripts AR-down-regulated. Thus, relative transcript levels may change with dry after-ripening partly as a consequence of differences in mRNA turnover.},

It binds to soluble pyrabactin resistance1/PYR1-like/regulatory component of ABA receptor receptors and stabilizes them in a conformation that inhibits clade A type II C protein phosphatases; this leads to downstream SnRK2 kinase activation and numerous cellular outputs. We previously described the synthetic naphthalene sulfonamide ABA agonist pyrabactin, which activates seed ABA responses but fails to trigger substantial responses in vegetative tissues in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we describe quinabactin, a sulfonamide ABA agonist that preferentially activates dimeric ABA receptors and possesses ABA-like potency in vivo. In Arabidopsis, the transcriptional responses induced by quinabactin are highly correlated with those induced by ABA treatments. Quinabactin treatments elicit guard cell closure, suppress water loss, and promote drought tolerance in adult Arabidopsis and soybean plants. The effects of quinabactin are sufficiently similar to those of ABA that it is able to rescue multiple phenotypes observed in the ABA-deficient mutant aba2. Genetic analyses show that quinabactin’s effects in vegetative tissues are primarily mediated by dimeric ABA receptors. A PYL2-quinabactin-HAB1 X-ray crystal structure solved at 1.98-Å resolution shows that quinabactin forms a hydrogen bond with the receptor/PP2C “lock” hydrogen bond network, a structural feature absent in pyrabactin-receptor/PP2C complexes. Our results demonstrate that ABA receptors can be chemically controlled to enable plant protection against water stress and define the dimeric receptors as key targets for chemical modulation of vegetative ABA responses.},

In 2017, a survey was conducted with Nebraska stakeholders in an attempt to evaluate current cover crop management strategies adopted in soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.), field corn (Zea mays L.), and seed corn production. Eighty-two Nebraska stakeholders answered the survey, of which 80\% identified themselves as growers. Eighty-seven percent of respondents manage cover crops, and the average cover crop ha planted on a per farm basis is 32\%. The primary method of establishing cover crops following soybeans and field corn is drilling. In seed corn, interseeding is the main seeding strategy for cover crop establishment. Cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) appeared as the most adopted cover crop species (either alone or in mixtures with radish [Raphanus sativus L.] or hairy vetch [Vicia villosa Roth]). Over 95\% of respondents utilize herbicides for cover crop termination in the spring before crop planting. Glyphosate is used by 100\% of survey respondents that use herbicides for cover crop termination. The major observed impacts of incorporating cover crops into a production system according to survey respondents are reduced soil erosion and weed suppression. According to 93\% of respondents, cover crops improve weed control by suppressing winter and/or summer annual weed species. The biggest challenge reported by cover crop adopters is planting and establishing a decent stand before winter.

However, when saflufenacil was applied PRE, regardless of the POST herbicide or when saflufenacil was applied POST with halosulfuron, barnyardgrass control was reduced to 78\% to 81\%, compared with 95\% to 96\% with the control with all other residual combinations. Yellow nutsedge and rice flatsedge control increased when treated with halosulfuron compared with penoxsulam across all evaluation dates.

  abstract = {Modern herbicides make major contributions to global food production by easily removing weeds and substituting for destructive soil cultivation. However, persistent herbicide selection of huge weed numbers across vast areas can result in the rapid evolution of herbicide resistance. Herbicides target specific enzymes, and mutations are selected that confer resistance-endowing amino acid substitutions, decreasing herbicide binding. Where herbicides bind within an enzyme catalytic site very few mutations give resistance while conserving enzyme functionality. Where herbicides bind away from a catalytic site many resistance-endowing mutations may evolve. Increasingly, resistance evolves due to mechanisms limiting herbicide reaching target sites. Especially threatening are herbicide-degrading cytochrome P450 enzymes able to detoxify existing, new, and even herbicides yet to be discovered. Global weed species are accumulating resistance mechanisms, displaying multiple resistance across many herbicides and posing a great challenge to herbicide sustainability in world agriculture. Fascinating genetic issues associated with resistance evolution remain to be investigated, especially the possibility of herbicide stress unleashing epigenetic gene expression. Understanding resistance and building sustainable solutions to herbicide resistance evolution are necessary and worthy challenges.},

  abstract = {Conservation tillage reduces the physical movement of soil to the minimum required for crop establishment and production. When consistently practiced as a soil and crop management system, it greatly reduces soil erosion and is recognized for the potential to improve soil quality and water conservation and plant available water. Adoption of conservation tillage increased dramatically with the advent of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant crops that permitted in-season, over-the-top use of glyphosate (N-[phosphonomethyl] glycine), a broad-spectrum herbicide with very low mammalian toxicity and minimal potential for off-site movement in soil or water. Glyphosate-resistant crops are currently grown on approximately 70 million ha (173 million ac) worldwide. The United States has the most hectares (45 million ha [99 million ac]) of transgenic, glyphosate-resistant cultivars and the greatest number of hectares (46 million ha [114 million ac]) in conservation tillage. The practice of conservation tillage is now threatened by the emergence and rapid spread of glyphosate-resistant Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri [S.] Wats.), one of several amaranths commonly called pigweeds. First identified in Georgia, it now has been reported in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Another closely related dioecious amaranth, or pigweed, common waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis Sauer), has also developed resistance to glyphosate in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Missouri. Hundreds of thousands of conservation tillage hectares, some currently under USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service conservation program contracts, are at risk of being converted to higher-intensity tillage systems due to the inability to control these glyphosate-resistant Amaranthus species in conservation tillage systems using traditional technologies. The decline of conservation tillage is inevitable without the development and rapid adoption of integrated, effective weed control strategies. Traditional and alternative weed control strategies, such as the utilization of crop and herbicide rotation and integration of high residue cereal cover crops, are necessary in order to sustain conservation tillage practices.},

In the Great Basin of North America, seeds sown in the fall to restore degraded sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) steppe plant communities may experience high mortality in winter due to exposure of seedlings to freezing temperatures and other stressors. Delaying germination until early spring when conditions are more suitable for growth may increase survival. We evaluated the use of BioNik™ (Valent BioSciences LLC) abscisic acid (ABA) to delay germination of bluebunch wheatgrass (Pseudoroegneria spicata). Seed was either left untreated or coated at five separate rates of ABA ranging from 0.25 to 6.0 g 100 g−1 of seed. Seeds were incubated at five separate constant temperatures from 5 to 25°C. From the resultant germination data, we developed quadratic thermal accumulation models for each treatment and applied them to 4 years of historic soil moisture and temperature data across six sagebrush steppe sites to predict germination timing. Total germination percentage remained similar across all temperatures except at 25°C, where high ABA rates had slightly lower values. All ABA doses delayed germination, with the greatest delays at 5–10°C. For example, the time required for 50\% of the seeds to germinate at 5°C was increased by 16–46 d, depending on the amount of ABA applied. Seed germination models predicted that the majority of untreated seed would germinate 5–11 weeks after a 15 October simulated planting date. In contrast, seeds treated with ABA were predicted to delay germination to late winter or early spring. These results indicate that ABA coatings may delay germination of fall planted seed until conditions are more suitable for plant survival and growth.},

  abstract = {The selection of herbicide-resistant weed populations began with the
introduction of synthetic herbicides in the late 1940s. For the first 20
years after introduction, there were limited reported cases of
herbicide-resistant weeds. This changed in 1968 with the discovery of
triazine-resistant common groundsel. Over the next 15 yr, the cases of
herbicide-resistant weeds increased, primarily to triazine herbicides.
Although triazine resistance was widespread, the resistant biotypes were
highly unfit and were easily controlled with specific alternative
herbicides. Weed scientists presumed that this would be the case for future
herbicide-resistant cases and thus there was not much concern, although the
companies affected by triazine resistance were somewhat active in trying to
detect and manage resistance. It was not until the late 1980s with the
discovery of resistance to Acetyl Co-A carboxylase (ACCase) and acetolactate
synthase (ALS) inhibitors that herbicide resistance attracted much more
attention, particularly from industry. The rapid evolution of resistance to
these classes of herbicides affected many companies, who responded by first
establishing working groups to address resistance to specific classes of
herbicides, and then by formation of the Herbicide Resistance Action
Committee (HRAC). The goal of these groups, in cooperation with academia and
governmental agencies, was to act as a forum for the exchange of information
on herbicide-resistance selection and to develop guidelines for managing
resistance. Despite these efforts, herbicide resistance continued to
increase. The introduction of glyphosate-resistant crops in the 1995
provided a brief respite from herbicide resistance, and farmers rapidly
adopted this relatively simple and reliable weed management system based on
glyphosate. There were many warnings from academia and some companies that
the glyphosate-resistant crop system was not sustainable, but this advice
was not heeded. The selection of glyphosate resistant weeds dramatically
changed weed management and renewed emphasis on herbicide resistance
management. To date, the lesson learned from our experience with herbicide
resistance is that no herbicide is invulnerable to selecting for resistant
biotypes, and that over-reliance on a weed management system based solely on
herbicides is not sustainable. Hopefully we have learned that a diverse weed
management program that combines multiple methods is the only system that
will work for the long term.},

They can also be invaluable assets for detection of invasions, assessment of infestation levels, monitoring rate of spread, and determining the efficacy of mitigation efforts for weed management. In combination with other technologies such as global positioning systems and geographic information systems, sampling strategies can be devised to efficiently determine the location of weed populations in agricultural and wildland situations. Maps created from remote sensing or sampling (or both) allow site-specific weed management of only the areas requiring corrective action. Potential benefits to the land managers and the ecosystem as a whole will come from reductions in inputs, reduced environmental liability from the detrimental effects of applying control measures to entire areas, crop yield increases through better management decisions, and early detection and effective management of invading species. Improvements in spatial and spectral resolution, temporal frequency, image turnaround time, and cost of image acquisition, combined with the realization of the value of the data, are enhancing the acceptance and usage of remote sensing technologies. However, remote sensing will be best used by providing accurate, site-specific data that can be converted into information used by decision support systems (DSSs). Advances in these DSSs, and their ability to incorporate remote sensing data, have been rapid and widespread in the past 10 yr. As a result, federal management and research agencies, academic institutions, and private entities have collectively developed efforts to use this information in monitoring and management efforts for invasive species in western rangelands, aquatic ecosystems and forestry, and site-specific weed management in agronomics.},

  abstract = {Research over the years has indicated improved control of certain annual broadleaf weeds in no-till cropping systems when mulches are left on the soil surface. Therefore, we initiated studies in no-till corn, soybeans, sunflower, and tobacco to evaluate and separate the effects of small grain mulches and tillage on broadleaf weeds. Planting corn no-till into a desiccated green wheat cover crop reduced Ipomoea spp. biomass 79\% compared to a non-mulched, tilled treatment. Elimination of tillage in non-mulched treatments was as effective in reducing weed biomass as replacing mulch on tilled soil. In double-crop soybeans, there was no mulch effect; tillage, however, greatly increased Ipomoea spp. biomass. In no-till tobacco, elimination of tillage and presence of a rye mulch reduced biomass of Amaranthus retroflexus L., Chenopodium album L., and Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. by 51, 41, and 73\%, respectively. Rye mulch reduced C. album biomass in both the tilled and the non-tilled systems by 60\%. In full-season soybeans and sunflowers planted into desiccated green rye, the elimination of tillage and the presence of rye mulch reduced aboveground biomass of C. album, A. artemisiifolia, and A. retroflexus 99, 92, and 96\%, respectively. Rye mulch was as effective as elimination of tillage in reducing C. album and A. retroflexus biomass. A. artemisiifolia was not significantly affected by rye mulch in any of these cropping systems. Allelopathic suppression of several broadleaf weeds by the mulches is implicated in these studies. In further studies to examine possible causes of weed suppression in no-till cropping systems utilizing killed rye (Secale cereale L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as a mulch, two phytotoxic compounds not previously implicated in allelopathy, β-phenyllactic acid (βPLA) and β-hydroxybutyric acid (βHBA), were identified from aqueous extracts of field-grown rye. The βPLA and βHBA at 8 mM inhibited Chenopodium album L. hypocotyl growth 68 and 30\%, respectively in laboratory bioassays. Both acids inhibited C. album root growth 20\% at 2 mM. Amaranthus retroflexus L. hypocotyl growth was inhibited 17\% by βPLA at 0.8 mM and 100\% at 8 mM with βHBA giving 27\% inhibition at 8 mM. A. retroflexus root growth was inhibited 59 and 39\% at 2 mM by βPLA and βHBA, respectively. The compound identified in alkali extracts from wheat having greatest inhibitory effects on Ipomoea lacunosa L. seed germination was identified as ferulic acid (4-hydroxy-3-methoxy cinnamic acid). At 5 mM, germination and root length was inhibited 23 and 82\%, respectively. Sida spinosa L. germination and root length, with carpels present on the seed, was inhibited 85 and 82\%, respectively. Ferulic acid was decarboxylated by a bacterium living on the carpels of S. spinosa seed to a more phytotoxic styrene derivative, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxystyrene. These compounds plus other unidentified phytotoxic chemicals could, in part, explain suppression of certain weeds by rye and wheat mulches in no-till crops.},

Seed dormancy and germination are distinct physiological processes, and the transition from dormancy to germination is not only a critical developmental step in the life cycle of plants but is also important for agricultural production. These processes are precisely regulated by diverse endogenous hormones and environmental cues. Although ABA (abscisic acid) and GAs (gibberellins) are known to be the primary phytohormones that antagonistically regulate seed dormancy, recent findings demonstrate that another phytohormone, auxin, is also critical for inducing and maintaining seed dormancy, and therefore might act as a key protector of seed dormancy. In this review, we summarize our current understanding of the sophisticated molecular networks involving the critical roles of phytohormones in regulating seed dormancy and germination, in which AP2-domain-containing transcription factors play~key roles. We also discuss the interactions (crosstalk) of diverse hormonal signals in seed dormancy and germination, focusing on the ABA/GA balance that constitutes the central node.},

  abstract = {Weeds are one of the most significant, and controllable, threats to crop production in North America. Monetary losses because of reduced soybean yield and decreased quality because of weed interference, as well as costs of controlling weeds, have a significant economic impact on net returns to producers. Previous Weed Science Society of America (WSSA) Weed Loss Committee reports, as chaired by Chandler (1984) and Bridges (1992), provided snapshots of the comparative crop yield losses because of weeds across geographic regions and crops within these regions after the implementation of weed control tactics. This manuscript is a second report from the current WSSA Weed Loss Committee on crop yield losses because of weeds, specifically in soybean. Yield loss estimates were determined from comparative observations of soybean yields between the weedy control and plots with greater than 95\% weed control in studies conducted from 2007 to 2013. Researchers from each US state and Canadian province provided at least three and up to ten individual comparisons for each year, which were then averaged within a year, and then averaged over the seven years. These percent yield loss values were used to determine total soybean yield loss in t ha−1 and bu acre−1 based on average soybean yields for each state or province as well as current commodity prices for a given year as summarized by USDA-NASS (2014) and Statistics Canada (2015). Averaged across 2007 to 2013, weed interference in soybean caused a 52.1\% yield loss. Based on 2012 census data in the US and Canada soybean was grown on 30,798,512 and 1,679,203 hectares with production of 80 million and 5 million tonnes, respectively. Using an average soybean price across 2007 to 2013 of US \$389.81 t−1 (\$10.61 bu−1), farm gate value would be reduced by US \$16.2 billion in the US and \$1.0 billion in Canada annually if no weed management tactics were employed.

Las malezas son una de las amenazas más significativas y controlables para la producción agrícola en Norteamérica. Las pérdidas monetarias producto de la reducción en el rendimiento de la soja y la disminución en la calidad debido a la interferencia de malezas y al costo de controlar a estas, tiene un impacto económico significativo en la rentabilidad de los productores. Reportes previos del comité de pérdidas por malezas de la Sociedad Americana de la Ciencia de Malezas (WSSA), bajo la dirección de Chandler (1984) y Bridges (1992) brindaron imágenes temporales de las pérdidas de rendimiento comparativas causadas por malezas en diferentes regiones geográficas y cultivos dentro de estas regiones después de la implementación de tácticas de control de malezas. Este manuscrito es un segundo reporte del comité actual de pérdidas por malezas de WSSA sobre pérdidas en rendimiento causadas por malezas, específicamente en soja. Los estimados de pérdida en rendimiento fueron determinados a partir de observaciones comparativas de rendimientos de soja entre testigos con malezas y parcelas con más de 95\% de control en estudios realizados desde 2007 a 2013. Investigadores de cada estado de Estados Unidos y de cada provincia de Canada brindaron al menos tres y hasta 10 comparaciones individuales para cada año, las cuales fueron promediadas dentro de cada año, y luego promediadas para los siete años. Estos valores de porcentaje de rendimiento fueron usados para determinar la pérdida total en soja en t ha−1 y bu acre−1 con base en el promedio de rendimiento de soja para cada estado o provincia y el precio de grano para cada año como lo resumen USDA-NASS (2014) y Statistics Canada (2015). Promediando los años de 2007 a 2013, la interferencia de malezas en soja causó un 52,1\% de pérdidas de rendimiento. Con base en los datos del censo de 2012 en Estados Unidos y Canada, se produjo soja en 30,798,512 y 1,679,203 hectáreas para una producción de 80 millones y 5 millones de toneladas, respectivamente. Usando una precio de la soja promedio para 2007 a 2013 de US \$389.81 t−1 (\$10,61 bu−1), el valor en puerta de finca se hubiera reducido en US \$16.6 miles de millones en los Estados Unidos y \$1.0 mil millones en Canada anualmente si no se hubieran empleado tácticas de manejo de malezas.},

  abstract = {Several auxin herbicides, such as 2, 4-D and dicamba, have been used to eradicate an exotic invasive weed Ipomoea cairica in subtropical China, but restraining the re-explosion of this weed is still a challenge. Since ethylene is one of the major intermediate functioning products during the eradication process, we explored the possibility, mechanism and efficiency of using ethephon which can release ethylene to control Ipomoea cairica. The results of the pot experiment showed that 7.2 g /L ethephon could totally kill Ipomoea cairica including the stems and roots. The water culture experiment indicated that ethephon released an abundance of ethylene directly in leaves and caused increases in electrolyte leakage, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), abscisic acid (ABA) and H2O2 and decreases in chlorophyll content and photosynthetic activity, finally leading to the death of Ipomoea cairica. The field experiment showed that the theoretical effective concentration of ethephon for controlling Ipomoea cairica (weed control efficacy, WCE = 98\%) was 4.06 g/L and the half inhibitory concentration (I50) was 0.56 g/L. More than 50\% of the accompanying species were insensitive to the phytotoxicity of ethephon. Therefore, ethephon is an excellent alternative herbicide for controlling Ipomoea cairica.},

  abstract = {Mulches on the soil surface are known to suppress weed emergence, but the quantitative relationships between emergence and mulch properties have not been clearly defined. A theoretical framework for describing the relationships among mulch mass, area index, height, cover, light extinction, and weed emergence is introduced. This theory is applied to data from experiments on emergence of four annual weed species through mulches of selected materials applied at six rates. Mulch materials, in order from lowest to highest surface-area-to-mass ratio, were bark chips, Zea mays stalks, Secale cereale, Trifolium incarnatum, Vicia villosa, Quercus leaves, and landscape fabric strips. The order of weed species' sensitivity to mulches was Amaranthus retroflexus {$>$} Chenopodium album {$>$} Setaria faberi {$>$} Abutilon theophrasti, regardless of mulch material. The success of emergence through mulches was related to the capacity of seedlings to grow around obstructing mulch elements under limiting light conditions. Mulch area index was a pivotal property for quantitatively defining mulch properties and understanding weed emergence through mulches. A two-parameter model of emergence as a function of mulch area index and fraction of mulch volume that was solid reasonably predicted emergence across the range of mulches investigated.},

Making this weed particularly problematic to manage is its demonstrated ability to evolve resistance to herbicides. Herbicides to which A. tuberculatus has evolved resistance are photosystem II inhibitors, acetolactate synthase inhibitors, protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitors, and glyphosate. Many populations of A. tuberculatus contain more than one of these resistances, severely limiting the options for effective herbicide control. A survey of multiple-herbicide resistance in A. tuberculatus revealed that all populations resistant to glyphosate contained resistance to acetolactate synthase inhibitors, and 40\% contained resistance to protoporphyrinogen oxidase inhibitors. The occurrences of multiple-herbicide resistances in A. tuberculatus illustrate the need for continued herbicide discovery efforts and/or the development of new strategies for weed management.},

The finding of these herbicides was a striking case of multiple independent discovery by four groups of workers in two countries, the United Kingdom and the United States: William G. Templeman and associates at Imperial Chemical Industries; Philip S. Nutman and associates at the Rothamsted Agricultural Experiment Station; Franklin D. Jones at the American Chemical Paint Company; and Ezra Kraus, John Mitchell, and associates at the University of Chicago and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Because of wartime and commercial secrecy, the usual procedures of scientific publication and patent disclosure were not followed; instead, the first scientific report on these herbicides occurred in a publication by workers who were not original discoverers. Considerable confusion consequently resulted concerning the discovery and the discoverers. This confusion has not been completely dispelled in subsequent years. The present report summarizes the complete story, clarifies the chronology of the discoverers and their publications, and makes the case that all four groups of workers deserve credit for this revolutionary advance. The scientific background of the discovery and events in its immediate aftermath, especially the ticklish patent situation, are also briefly chronicled.},

Some of the key aspects of plant growth include seed development, germination and plant survival under unfavorable conditions. Two of the key phytohormones regulating the associated physiological processes are gibberellins (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA). GAs participate in numerous developmental processes, including, seed development and seed germination, seedling growth, root proliferation, determination of leaf size and shape, flower induction and development, pollination and fruit expansion. Despite the association with abiotic stresses, ABA is essential for normal plant growth and development. It plays a critical role in different abiotic stresses by regulating various downstream ABA-dependent stress responses. Plants maintain a balance between GA and ABA levels constantly throughout the developmental processes at different tissues and organs, including under unfavorable environmental or physiological conditions. Here, we will review the literature on how GA and ABA control different stages of plant development, with focus on seed germination and selected abiotic stresses. The possible crosstalk of ABA and GA in specific events of the above processes will also be discussed, with emphasis on downstream stress signaling components, kinases and transcription factors (TFs). The importance of several key ABA and GA signaling intermediates will be illustrated. The knowledge gained from such studies will also help to establish a solid foundation to develop future crop improvement strategies.},

Factors contributing to these increases differ from crop to crop. To obtain information on this subject, several experts on each crop were consulted, and their conclusions are summarized in the following text. Only those factors contributing to increased yields are covered. However, great improvements in efficiency of production, product quality, and reduction in soil erosion also have occurred as cultivars and production practices have changed. For most of the crops, increases in yields started in the 1940s and have increased dramatically during the rest of the century. We have not attempted to predict the future at this time, but the rate at which yields are increasing does not appear to be slowing.},

  abstract = {Traditional breeding has been used to develop grain sorghum germplasm that is tolerant to acetolactate synthase (ALS)-inhibiting herbicides (Inzen Technology, DuPont). Inzen sorghum carries a double mutation in the ALS gene (Val560Ile and Trp574Leu), which confers high level of tolerance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. Overreliance on ALS-inhibiting herbicides for weed control during the 1990s resulted in the evolution of ALS inhibitor–resistant shattercane populations in Nebraska. According to a survey conducted in 2013, ALS inhibitor–resistant weedy Sorghum populations persist in Nebraska. The objectives of this research were to determine whether the ALS mutations present in Inzen sorghum were present in the ALS inhibitor–resistant shattercane and johnsongrass populations detected in Nebraska and northern Kansas, and whether these populations evolved ALS resistance independently. Primers specific to the Val560 and Trp574 region of the ALS gene were used to screen the populations with PCR. The Trp574Leu mutation was present in one ALS inhibitor–resistant johnsongrass population. The Val560Ile was detected in three ALS inhibitor–resistant shattercane, one susceptible shattercane, one ALS inhibitor–resistant johnsongrass, and one susceptible johnsongrass population. Moreover, Val560Ile was present in resistant and/or susceptible individuals within johnsongrass and shattercane populations that were segregating for ALS resistance, indicating that by itself the Val560Ile mutation does not confer resistance to ALS-inhibiting herbicides. None of the populations presented both mutations simultaneously, as does Inzen sorghum. A shattercane population containing the Ser653Thr mutation was also detected. This research indicates that the ALS mutations present in Inzen sorghum already exist individually in weedy sorghum populations. Moreover, our results present strong evidence that ALS resistance in these populations evolved independently. Thus, widespread overreliance on ALS-inhibiting herbicides prior to adoption of glyphosate-tolerant crops in the 1990s exerted sufficient selective pressure on shattercane and johnsongrass populations for resistance to evolve multiple times in the Midwest. Finally, a survey of the 5′ portion of the ALS gene in more diverse wild and weedy Sorghum species was hampered by limited coverage in genomic resequencing surveys, suggesting that refined PCR-based methods will be needed to assess SNP variation in this gene region, which includes the Ala122, Pro197, and Ala205 codons known to confer ALS resistance in other species.},

  abstract = {First- and second-year seedbank emergence of 23 summer annual weed species
common to U.S. corn production systems was studied. Field experiments were
conducted between 1996 and 1999 at the Iowa State University Johnson Farm in
Story County, Iowa. In the fall of 1996 and again in 1997, 1,000 seeds for
most species were planted in plastic crates. Seedling emergence was counted
weekly for a 2-yr period following seed burial (starting in early spring).
Soil temperature at 2 cm depth was estimated using soil temperature and
moisture model software (STM2). The Weibull function was fit to
cumulative emergence (\%) on cumulative thermal time (TT), hydrothermal time
(HTT), and day of year (DOY). To identify optimum base temperature
(Tbase) and base matric potential (ψbase) for
calculating TT or HTT, Tbase and ψbase values ranging
from 2 to 17 C and −33 to −1,500 kPa, respectively, were evaluated for each
species. The search for the optimal model for each species was based on the
Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), whereas an extra penalty cost was
added to HTT models. In general, fewer seedlings emerged during the first
year of the first experimental run (approximately 18\% across all species)
than during the second experimental run (approximately 30\%). However,
second-year seedbank emergence was similar for both experimental runs
(approximately 6\%). Environmental effects may be the cause of differences in
total seedling emergence among years. Based on the AIC criterion, for 17
species, the best fit of the model occurred using Tbase ranging
from 2 to 15 C with four species also responding to ψbase = −750
kPa. For six species, a simple model using DOY resulted in the best fit.
Adding penalty costs to AIC calculation allowed us to compare TT and HTT
when both models behaved similarly. Using a constant Tbase,
species were plotted and classified as early-, middle-, and late-emerging
species, resulting in a practical tool for forecasting time of emergence.
The results of this research provide robust information on the prediction of
the time of summer annual weed emergence, which can be used to schedule weed
and crop management.},
