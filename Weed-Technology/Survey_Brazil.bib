However, its implementation raises enormous political, technological, and social challenges. Meeting these challenges will require, among other things, accurate information on the spatial and temporal patterns of agricultural land use and yield. Here, we investigate historical patterns of agricultural land use (1940–2012) and productivity (1990–2012) in Brazil using a new high-resolution (approximately 1 km2) spatially explicit reconstruction. Although Brazilian agriculture has been historically known for its extensification over natural vegetation (Amazon and Cerrado), data from recent years indicate that extensification has slowed down and was replaced by a strong trend of intensification. Our results provide the first comprehensive historical overview of agricultural land use and productivity in Brazil, providing clear insights to guide future territorial planning, sustainable agriculture, policy, and decision-making.},

Maximum injury from a single 2,4-D choline+glyphosate application at 1X (1140+1140 g ae ha−1) and 2X rate was 4\% and 13\%, respectively, at 3 days after treatment in the temperate Humid Pampa region. Slightly higher injury of 11 and 23\% was observed in sub-tropical region of northern Argentina. Injury was transient with recovery occurring within 14 days. Injury caused by sequential applications was equivalent to that caused by single applications. Soybean yield was not affected by single nor sequential applications. In four trials, control programs containing 2,4-D choline+glyphosate applied PRE and POST provided greater GR Sumatran fleabane control and a 12 to 26\% increase in yield compared to 2,4-D choline+glyphosate applied at PRE only.

In areas that fully adopted glyphosate and GR crops, GR weeds evolved and glyphosate and glyphosate traits now must be combined with other technologies. The chemical company solution is to combine glyphosate with other chemicals, and the seed company solution is to combine glyphosate resistance with other traits. Unfortunately, companies have not discovered a new commercial herbicide mode-of-action for over 30 years and have already developed or are developing traits for all existing herbicide types with high utility. Glyphosate mixtures and glyphosate trait combinations will be the mainstays of weed management for many growers, but are not going to be enough to keep up with the capacity of weeds to evolve resistance. Glufosinate, auxin, HPPD-inhibiting and other herbicide traits, even when combined with glyphosate resistance, are incremental and temporary solutions. Herbicide and seed businesses are not going to be able to support what critics call the chemical and transgenic treadmills for much longer. The long time without the discovery of a new herbicide mode-of-action and the epidemic of resistant weeds is forcing many growers to spend much more to manage weeds and creating a worst of times, best of times predicament for the crop protection and seed industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry},

Reductions in 14C-absorption and spray retention were due to the salt formulations of dicamba rather than the parent acid.

Another possibility for efficient erosion control was shown to be the no-tillage technique. Due to a higher soil moisture content, lower soil temperature, especially at sowing, and higher biological activity of the soil, yields of wheat and soybeans were usually higher in the no-tillage system than under conventional tillage, especially in a dry year. At one site, where no-tillage was performed without the use of herbicides, wheat yield was reduced due to weed competition. Some cover crops, direct-drilled into soybean stubble, produced during winter more than 6 t/ha of dry matter.},

  abstract = {There is Agro-climatic concern that the widespread use of dicamba-based herbicides in Dicamba-Tolerant (DT) soybeans can result in un-intended drift onto non-DT crops in nearby field due to windy conditions and volatility. New dicamba-based products such as Engenia® and XtendiMax® with Vapor Grip technology were developed to reduce volatility, however, they are not completely volatile-free. A study was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity of pot-grown grape and tomato to six micro-rates of three dicamba-based products (Clarity®, Engenia® and XtendiMax®) in 2016 and 2017, at Haskell Ag Lab, Concord (42.37oN, 96.68oW), NE, USA. The tested dicamba formulations negatively impacted growth of grape and tomato as measured by vine length and plant height respectively, as well as by plant biomass. About 2\% of the label rate was high enough to cause 50\% injury and reduction in vine length or plant height. For example, a dose of 6.54 to 9.13 g ae ha-1 and 3.98 to 5.35 g ae ha-1 caused 50\% injury in grape and tomato respectively, at 21 DAT. At 50\% injury and vine reduction threshold, grape appeared more sensitive to XtendiMax® than Clarity® and Engenia®. For instance, a dose of 1.83 g ae ha-1 of XtendiMax® was required to cause 50\% reduction in vine length (\textasciitilde 49 cm) compared to significantly higher dose of 5.64 and 7.59 g ae ha-1 required for Clarity® and Engenia®, respectively. However, in tomato, there was no significant difference in sensitivity to all three products. In general, the present study showed that grape and tomato were very sensitive to micro-rates of all three dicamba products, irrespective of the of the new dicamba technology that reduces volatility. Hence, efforts should be made to avoid drift of dicamba onto these crops.},

Treatments were made using a spray system calibrated to deliver 0.757 L min−1 at 276 kPa and 4.8 km h−1.

Injury (35\%) at 357 DAT was noted only in plants treated with the highest rate of 2,4-D. French hybrids showed slightly less injury symptoms compared with wine grapes at 7 and 42 DAT. Shoot length reduction in plants treated with 2,4-D at the highest rate was 43, 84, and 16\% at 7, 42, and 357 DAT, respectively.

Spray drift of 2,4-D and dicamba can severely injure grapes, with injury increasing with increased exposure. The combination of 2,4-D plus glyphosate caused greater injury and shoot length reduction in grapes than glyphosate applied alone.

There also appeared to be a minimum temperature of \textasciitilde 15 C at which dicamba decreased to low levels. The addition of glyphosate to dicamba formulations decreased the spray mixture pH and increased the observed dicamba air concentrations. Adding glyphosate to DGA+VG increased detectable dicamba air concentrations by 2.9 to 9.3 times across the temperature ranges examined. Particle drift would not be expected to be a factor in the research, as applications were made remotely before treated soil was transported into the greenhouse. The most probable reason for the increased detection of dicamba at higher temperatures and with mixtures of glyphosate is via volatility.},

Adding BAPMA salt of dicamba always increased the mixture pH, whereas diglycolamine þ VaporGrip® (DGAþVG) had a mixed response. The addition of AMS decreased pH slightly (usually {$<$}0.5 pH unit), whereas the addition of potassium salt of glyphosate (GLY-K) always decreased the measured pH (from 1.0 to 2.1 pH units). A substantial pH change could have profound effects on dicamba volatility. Moreover, the 1.0 to 2.1 pH units would not be consistent with the registrant’s report stating that GLY-K decreased mixtures with DGAþVG pH by only 0.2 to 0.3 units. The drift retardant Intact had no effect on pH. There was no difference in resultant pH when comparing K salt and isopropylamine (IPA) salts of glyphosate. Spray carrier volume, ranging from 94 to 187 L ha–1, had only a minor effect on measured pH after the addition of various spray components. The addition of selected pH modifiers raised the pH above 5.0, which is a critical value according to the latest dicamba application labels. The order of mixing of various pH modifiers, including AMS, had only limited effect on measured spray solution pH.},

  abstract = {The adoption of glyphosate-based crop production systems has been one of the most important revolutions in the history of agriculture. Changes in weed communities owing to species that do not respond to current glyphosate-based management tactics are rapidly increasing. Clearly, glyphosate-resistant crops (GRCs) do not influence weeds any more than non-transgenic crops. For most crops, the trait itself is essentially benign in the environment. Rather, the weed control tactics imposed by growers create the ecological selection pressure that ultimately changes the weed communities. This is seen in the adoption of conservation tillage and weed management programs that focus on one herbicide mode of action and have hastened several important weed population shifts. Tillage (disturbance) is one of the primary factors that affect changes in weed communities. The intense selection pressure from herbicide use will result in the evolution of herbicide-resistant weed biotypes or shifts in the relative prominence of one weed species in the weed community. Changes in weed communities are inevitable and an intrinsic consequence of growing crops over time. The glyphosate-based weed management tactics used in GRCs impose the selection pressure that supports weed population shifts. Examples of weed population shifts in GRCs include common waterhemp [Amaranthus tuberculatus (Moq ex DC) JD Sauer], horseweed (Conyza canadensis L), giant ragweed (Ambrosia trifida L) and other relatively new weed problems. Growers have handled these weed population shifts with varying success depending on the crop. Copyright © 2008 Society of Chemical Industry},

  abstract = {Glyphosate-resistant (GR) waterhemp is the fifth confirmed GR weed in Canada and was first confirmed in 2014 in the province of Ontario. In 2015 and 2016, two field experiments were conducted across four site–years each to determine the effectiveness of dicamba at two rates (300 and 600 g a.i. ha−1) in addition to dimethenamid-P (693 g a.i. ha−1) in a single and sequential management program. Due to traited soybean seed availability, all treatments were applied in corn. Waterhemp density, biomass, visual control estimates, and corn yield were collected. Waterhemp density and dryweight were found to be lower in treatments including a sequential application of dicamaba and those that included dimethenamid-P. The sequential management strategy provided {$>$}95\% control of GR waterhemp at 12 weeks after application. Dicamba applied after emergence at 300 and 600 g a.i. ha−1 controlled GR waterhemp 80\% and 91\%, respectively; in contrast, dicamba applied before emergence at 300 and 600 g a.i. ha−1 provided only 9\% and 30\% control of GR waterhemp, respectively. Dimethenamid-P controlled waterhemp better than dicamba when applied before emergence. Corn yield was also impacted by herbicide timing as corn yield was reduced by 17\%–23\% comparing preemergence vs postemergence applications in the experiments presented.},

            Six experiments were conducted in 2018 on field sites located in Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Ontario, and Wisconsin to evaluate the off-target movement (OTM) of dicamba under field-scale conditions. The highest estimated percentages of dicamba injury in non–dicamba-resistant (DR) soybean were 55\%, 44\%, 39\%, 67\%, 15\%, and 44\% injury for noncovered areas and 55\%, 5\%, 13\%, 42\%, 0\%, and 41\% injury for covered areas during dicamba application in Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Nebraska, Ontario, and Wisconsin, respectively. The level of injury generally decreased as the downwind distance increased under covered and noncovered areas at all sites. There was an estimated 10\% injury in non-DR soybean at 113, 8, 11, 8, and 8 m; and estimated 1\% injury at 293, 28, 71, 15, and 19 m from the edge of treated fields downwind when plants were not covered during dicamba application in Arkansas, Indiana, Michigan, Ontario, and Wisconsin, respectively. Assessment of filter-paper collectors placed from 4 to 137 m downwind from the edge of the sprayed area suggested the dicamba deposition reduced exponentially with distance. The greatest injury to non-DR soybean from dicamba OTM occurred at Nebraska and Arkansas (as far as 250 m). Non-DR soybean injury was greatest adjacent to the dicamba sprayed area, but injury decreased with no injury beyond 20 m downwind or in any other direction from the dicamba sprayed area in Indiana, Michigan, Ontario, and Wisconsin. The presence of soybean injury under covered and noncovered areas during the spray period for primary drift suggests that secondary movement of dicamba was evident at five sites. Additional research is needed to determine the exact forms of secondary movement of dicamba under different environmental conditions.},

The addition of dicamba at 300 or 600 g ha−1 to clethodim (30 g ha−1) resulted in antagonism, causing a reduction in volunteer GR corn by 12 and 11\%, respectively. In general, there was greater antagonism when the high rate of dicamba was tank-mixed with the lower rate of the graminicide. There was no antagonistic effect on soybean yield by tank-mixing dicamba with either graminicide at all rates evaluated. Based on these results, volunteer GR corn can be controlled effectively by increasing the rate of the graminicide when tankmixed with dicamba.

            In 2017, dicamba-resistant (DR) soybean was commercially available to farmers in the United States. In August and September of 2017, a survey of 312 farmers from 60 Nebraska soybean-producing counties was conducted during extension field days or online. The objective of this survey was to understand farmers’ adoption and perceptions regarding DR soybean technology in Nebraska. The survey contained 16 questions and was divided in three parts: (1) demographics, (2) dicamba application in DR soybean, and (3) dicamba off-target injury to sensitive soybean cultivars. According to the results, 20\% of soybean hectares represented by the survey were planted to DR soybean in 2017, and this number would probably double in 2018. Sixty-five percent of survey respondents own a sprayer and apply their own herbicide programs. More than 90\% of respondents who adopted DR soybean technology reported significant improvement in weed control. Nearly 60\% of respondents used dicamba alone or glyphosate plus dicamba for POST weed control in DR soybean; the remaining 40\% added an additional herbicide with an alternative site of action (SOA) to the POST application. All survey respondents used one of the approved dicamba formulations for application in DR soybean. Survey results indicated that late POST dicamba applications (after late June) were more likely to result in injury to non-DR soybean compared to early POST applications (e.g., May and early June) in 2017. According to respondents, off-target dicamba movement resulted both from applications in DR soybean and dicamba-based herbicides applied in corn. Although 51\% of respondents noted dicamba injury on non-DR soybean, 7\% of those who noted injury filed an official complaint with the Nebraska Department of Agriculture. Although DR soybean technology allowed farmers to achieve better weed control during 2017 than previous growing seasons, it is apparent that off-target movement and resistance management must be addressed to maintain the viability and effectiveness of the technology in the future.},

  abstract = {Engineered glyphosate resistance is the most widely adopted genetically modified trait in agriculture, gaining widespread acceptance by providing a simple robust weed control system. However, extensive and sustained use of glyphosate as a sole weed control mechanism has led to field selection for glyphosate-resistant weeds and has induced significant population shifts to weeds with inherent tolerance to glyphosate. Additional weed control mechanisms that can complement glyphosate-resistant crops are, therefore, urgently needed. 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D) is an effective low-cost, broad-spectrum herbicide that controls many of the weeds developing resistance to glyphosate. We investigated the substrate preferences of bacterial aryloxyalkanoate dioxygenase enzymes (AADs) that can effectively degrade 2,4-D and have found that some members of this class can act on other widely used herbicides in addition to their activity on 2,4-D. AAD-1 cleaves the aryloxyphenoxypropionate family of grass-active herbicides, and AAD-12 acts on pyridyloxyacetate auxin herbicides such as triclopyr and fluroxypyr. Maize plants transformed with an AAD-1 gene showed robust crop resistance to aryloxyphenoxypropionate herbicides over four generations and were also not injured by 2,4-D applications at any growth stage. Arabidopsis plants expressing AAD-12 were resistant to 2,4-D as well as triclopyr and fluroxypyr, and transgenic soybean plants expressing AAD-12 maintained field resistance to 2,4-D over five generations. These results show that single AAD transgenes can provide simultaneous resistance to a broad repertoire of agronomically important classes of herbicides, including 2,4-D, with utility in both monocot and dicot crops. These transgenes can help preserve the productivity and environmental benefits of herbicide-resistant crops.},
